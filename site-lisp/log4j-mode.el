;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a major mode for viewing log files, including syntax
;; highlighting, filtering, and source code browsing.
;;
;; Log records are syntax highlighted using keywords such as INFO and ERROR.
;; Customizable regular expressions are used to find the beginning and end of
;; multi-line log records.
;;
;; To filter a log file buffer, type `C-c C-s', and enter the desired filter
;; criteria - any number of keywords separated by spaces. Log records that
;; contain any of the words in the include list, and none of the words in the
;; exclude list, will be copied to the filter buffer. All other log records
;; will be discarded. If the include list is blank, all log records will be
;; included. If the exclude list is blank, no records will be excluded. If the
;; log file buffer is auto reverted, the filter buffer will be updated too. To
;; stop filtering the log file buffer, just type `C-c C-s' again.
;;
;; To show the source code for a Java identifier found in the log file, place
;; the point in the identifier, and type `C-c C-b'. Log4j mode will parse the
;; expression around point, and look up the Java identifier found using jtags
;; - an Emacs package for editing and browsing Java source code.
;;
;; This command is only enabled if package jtags is loaded. Note that this
;; version of Log4j mode requires jtags version 0.95 or later. For more
;; information about jtags, see http://jtags.sourceforge.net.
;;
;; Finally, the commands `M-}' and `M-{' are redefined to move to the end
;; and beginning of the current log record.
;;
;; The latest version of Log4j mode can always be found at
;; http://log4j-mode.sourceforge.net.

;; Installation:

;; Place "log4j-mode.el" in your `load-path' and place the following lines
;; of code in your init file:
;;
;; (autoload 'log4j-mode "log4j-mode" "Major mode for viewing log files." t)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.log\\'" . log4j-mode))
;;
;; To enable source code browsing, place "jtags.el" in your `load-path' too.

;; Configuration:

;; You can customize the faces that are used for syntax highlighting.
;; Type `M-x customize-group' and enter group name "log4j-mode".
;;
;; Log file buffers are auto reverted by default. If you don't like that,
;; set `log4j-auto-revert-flag' to nil.
;;
;; You can also customize the regular expressions that are used to find the
;; beginning and end of multi-line log records. However, in many cases this
;; will not be necessary. Log4j mode can automatically detect single-line and
;; multi-line log records created by Log4j and JDK's built-in logging package.
;;
;; If you use the arrow keys to move around in the text, you can define `C-up'
;; and `C-down' to move to the end and beginning of the current log record.
;; Put the following lines of code in your init file:
;;
;; (add-hook
;;  'log4j-mode-hook
;;  (lambda ()
;;    (define-key log4j-mode-local-map [(control down)] 'log4j-forward-record)
;;    (define-key log4j-mode-local-map [(control up)] 'log4j-backward-record)))

;; XEmacs:

;; XEmacs tends to move the point to `point-min' when auto reverting a buffer.
;; Setting the customizable variable `log4j-restore-point-flag' to 't leaves
;; the point at its original position.
;;
;; To tell XEmacs which tags table files to use for log files, modify variable
;; `tag-table-alist' to include log files. Using the example in file "jtags.el"
;; you could put the following lines of code in your init file:
;;
;; (setq tag-table-alist '(("\\.\\(java\\|log\\)$" . "c:/java/j2sdk1.4.2/src")
;;                         ("\\.\\(java\\|log\\)$" . "c:/projects/tetris/src")))

;;; Change Log:

;;  1.3    2008-02-28  Changed load method to autoload. Fixed several XEmacs
;;                     bugs. Added customization of Auto Revert mode.
;;  1.2.1  2008-02-01  Updated to work with jtags version 0.95.
;;  1.2    2006-11-30  Log4j mode is a full major mode, not a Generic mode.
;;                     Rewrote syntax highlighting and filtering to support
;;                     multi-line log records. Improved filtering performance.
;;                     Added source code browsing and commands for moving
;;                     across log records. Added hook variables.
;;  1.1    2006-10-04  Ported to XEmacs. Changed key bindings. Highlights
;;                     complete line.
;;  1.0    2006-01-03  Initial version.

(defun log4j-mode ()
  "Major mode for viewing log files.
Log4j mode provides syntax highlighting and filtering of log files.
It also provides functionality to find and display the declaration
of a Java identifier found in the log file.

You can customize the faces that are used for syntax highlighting.
Type `M-x customize-group' and enter group name \"log4j-mode\".
You can also customize the regular expressions that are used to find
the beginning and end of multi-line log records. However, in many
cases this will not be necessary.

Commands:
Use `\\<log4j-mode-map>\\[log4j-start-filter]' to start/stop log file filtering in the current buffer.
Enter any number of include and exclude keywords that will be used to
filter the log records. Keywords are separated by spaces.

Use `\\<log4j-mode-map>\\[log4j-browse-source]' to show the declaration of the Java identifier around or
before point. This command is only enabled if package `jtags' is loaded.
For more information about jtags, see http://jtags.sourceforge.net.

Finally, the commands `\\<log4j-mode-map>\\[log4j-forward-record]' and `\\<log4j-mode-map>\\[log4j-backward-record]' move point forward and backward
across log records.
