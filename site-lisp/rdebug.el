;;; Commentary:

;;
;; Introduction:
;;
;; This is a full-blown debugger user interface to the Ruby rdebug
;; debugger shell.
;;
;; The main features are:
;;
;;  * Window layout with dedicated windows for:
;;      + Local and member variables
;;      + Stack trace
;;      + Display expressions
;;      + Breakpoints
;;      + Output
;;      + Debugger Shell
;;
;;  * Source-level debugging:
;;      + The current source file is shown and current line is marked.
;;      + Function keys bindings for effective stepping in the source code.
;;      + A "Debugger" menu for easy access to all features.
;;
;;  * A number of predefined window layouts and key bindings are
;;    supplied, including binding that emulate Eclipse and NetBeans.
;;    The user can easily provide their own window layout and
;;    settings.
;;
;; The default window layout looks like the following:
;;
;; +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
;; |                                Toolbar                               |
;; +-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
;; | Debugger Stack Buffer             | Local Variables buffer           |
;; +-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
;; |                                                                      |
;; |                           Source buffer                              |
;; |                                                                      |
;; +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
;; |                        Debugger Command Buffer                       |
;; +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
;;

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; To use this package, place the either of following lines in an
;; appropriate init file (for example ~/.emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'rdebug)
;; or
;;    (autoload 'rdebug "rdebug" "ruby-debug interface" t)    


;;
;; History and Future:
;;
;; The design of this debugger user interface was inspired by
;; `gdb-ui', a similar user interface to GDB.
;;
;; Hopefully, rdebug, gdb-ui, and other emacs user interfaces could
;; join forces to create a common user-level look and feel, and a
;; battery of underlying support functions.
;;

;;
;; This file contains only user-customizable variables and code to
;; load the other files when needed.
;;

;;; Code:

;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Consistency checks.

(if (< emacs-major-version 22)
    (error
     "This version of rdebug.el needs at least Emacs 22 or greater - you have version %d."

;; Support functions.

(defun rdebug-directory ()
  "The directory of this file, or nil."

      nil)))


(defun rdebug-compare-filenames (f1 f2)
  "Canonicalize and compare file names."
  ;; Canonicalize by:
  ;;  1) file-truename ensures that the file has got the correct case,
  ;;     and that "..":s in the path are eliminated.
  ;;  2) file-name-as-directory ensures "/foo" and "/foo/" becomes equal.

  ;; Note: for some reason, when the `comp-elisp' external program is
  ;; used, `nil' is part of `load-path'.
  (if f1
      (setq f1 (file-name-as-directory (file-truename f1))))
  (if f2
      (setq f2 (file-name-as-directory (file-truename f2))))
  (equal f1 f2))

;; that all the user have do to use this package is to load this file.

By default, the \"standard\" user window layout looks like the following:

The variable `rdebug-many-windows-layout-function' can be
customized so that another layout is used. In addition to a
number of predefined layouts it's possible to define a function
to perform a custom layout.

If `rdebug-many-windows' is nil, only a traditional debugger
shell and source window is opened.

The directory containing the debugged script becomes the initial
working directory and source-file directory for your debugger.

The custom variable `gud-rdebug-command-name' sets the command
and options used to invoke rdebug." t)
