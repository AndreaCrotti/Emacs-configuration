Emacs configuration
*WARNING*:
Changing code in miniconf.el will have no effect, since at next restart it will be overwritten.

I suggest for customization to use the file custom.el or at worst to clone this project.

* Features
  - yasnippet
  - desktop mode and nice hooks
  - auto completion
  - python-mode
  - haskell-mode
  - org-mode & org-babel
  - elscreen for tabs navigation
  - flymake for compilation errors directly in buffers
  - code folding and navigation via semantic in all languages supported
  - on MAC showing last combination pressed with growl and some ad hoc functions

* Usage
  To try it out:
  - git clone git://github.com/AndreaCrotti/Emacs-configuration.git
  - Create a file "custom.el" in /your/path/Emacs-configuration and write it in it
    (setq base "~/your/path/Emacs-configuration/")
  - Create or modify your *.emacs* in your $HOME with the following:
    + (cd "/your/path")
    + (load-file "orgloader.el")

  When you want to update the configuration just run a 
  *git pull*
  Unless you changed some code that generates a conflict the merge should be automatic.
  You can customize some of the variables created in this conf via
  *M-x customize-group RET miniconf*
  
** Your own settings
   If you want to add some personal settings you can
   - modify directly this file
   - add them to an external "file.el" (or in "private.el" or in "custom.el")
   
   Just keep in mind that if you modify directly the file miniconf.org when you try to pull my last changes there could be some conflicts and you might need to merge them.

   Also notice that the file miniconf.el is automatically generated from the org file, any change to it will be discarded next time you load emacs.

* Where you can get emacs 23:
** OSX:
   Emacs has bindings for many different UI systems, there are native versions for most of the operating systems.
   [[http://atomized.org/wp-content/cocoa-emacs-nightly/][emacs osx nightly builds]]
   If you want an easier fork for OSX there is [[http://aquamacs.org/][aquamacs]]

   [[http://lds.li/post/583988654/cocoa-emacs-23-2-final-build-for-os-x][Here]] you can find a build for cocoa emacs 23.2, now fullscreen finally works calling *ns-toggle-fullscreen*

** Windows:
   For windows there is an external package to simplify, [[http://www.ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32Util.html][emacsW32, make it easier on windows]]
   [[http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/][Emacs build for windows]]

** Linux
   Normally a emacs23 package is included in every distribution
