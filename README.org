Emacs configuration

The configuration loader is in ca-init.el, and all the submodules are
in the modules directory.

Previously everything was in *conf.org*, an org-mode file contanining
all the code. The file is still but now it contains only some
documentation and useful links.

  - desktop mode and nice hooks
  - auto completion with company mode
  - python-mode
  - haskell-mode
  - tuareg-mode
  - flycheck

  And much more...

* Usage
  To try it out:
  - git clone git://github.com/AndreaCrotti/Emacs-configuration.git
  - git submodule update --init
  - create an empty "custom.el" where you cloned the repository
  - Create or modify your *.emacs* in your $HOME with the following:
    + (setq base "~/Emacs-configuration/")
    + (load (concat base "ca-init.el"))

  Most of them can be compiled but it's not necessary, check the
  instructions in the README/INSTALL files in the appropriate paths
  To customize I suggest to use M-x customize (will write on your
  custom file) or write your own setqs in the custom.el file.
