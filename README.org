Emacs configuration

To try it out:

- Create a file "base.el" with something like:
  (setq base "~/your/base/path/")
- Lauch it with something like
  /path/to/your/emacs -q --load="orgloader.el"
- Make sure that you (or create an empty one) the file, "custom.el"
  That file will be managed automatically by the customization framework if you wish to use it.

Be aware that you *might need Emacs 23* for some of the features.

Where you can get emacs 23:
* OSX:
  Emacs has bindings for many different UI systems, there are native versions for most of the operating systems.

  If you want an easier fork for OSX there is [[http://aquamacs.org/][aquamacs]]

* Windows:
  For windows there is an external package to simplify, [[http://www.ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32Util.html][emacsW32, make it easier on windows]]
  [[http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/][Emacs build for windows]]

* Linux
  Normally a emacs23 package is included in every distribution
