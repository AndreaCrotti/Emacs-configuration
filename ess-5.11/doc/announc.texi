The ESS Developers proudly announce the release of ESS
@include ../VERSION

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
S-PLUS, R, SAS, BUGS and other statistical analysis packages under
the Unix, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Mac OS operating systems.
ESS is a package for the GNU Emacs and XEmacs text editors whose
features ESS uses to streamline the creation and use of statistical
software.  ESS knows the syntax and grammar of statistical analysis
packages and provides consistent display and editing features based
on that knowledge.  ESS assists in interactive and batch execution
of statements written in these statistical analysis languages.

ESS is freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please read the file COPYING which comes with the distribution, for
more information about the license. For more detailed information,
please read the README files that come with ESS.
@c And to clear up any possible confusion; the name is ESS, NOT ESS-mode.
@c Thank you :-).
