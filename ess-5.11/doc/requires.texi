ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata and JAGS. The one exception
is BUGS which is quite old, but should still work.

ESS supports current/recent versions of GNU Emacs and XEmacs. 
Most notably, the GNU Emacs 22 series and XEmacs 21.4.14 or higher
(beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED).

@c with the following versions of emacs

@c @itemize @bullet
@c @item GNU Emacs 20.3-7, 21.1, 21.3-4, 22.1
@c @item XEmacs 21.4.0-8, 21.4.9-13@footnote{
@c require the files.el patch to revert-buffer for the Local Variables
@c updating problem}, 21.4.14-15, 21.4.17-22 (betas not supported, but 21.5.23+ may work)
@c @c @item GNU Emacs <20.3 and XEmacs <21.0@footnote{These releases of emacs are no
@c @c longer supported, so an upgrade is recommended if you plan to use ESS.
@c @c If you have GNU Emacs 19.29, see @xref{Unix installation}.  Also, note
@c @c that the `custom' library bundled with Emacs 19.34 is too _old_, its API is
@c @c incompatible with the `new custom' bundled with recent Emacsen.
@c @c The `new custom' for Emacs 19.34 is available for download
@c @c @uref{ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz, here}.}
