@c There no longer is an anonymous CVS repository for ESS, due to lack of
@c interest, little demand, and problems with security.

@c text below modified from R-admin.texi (thanks to Kurt for the tip).

The latest development version of ESS is available via
@uref{https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/}, the ESS Subversion repository.  If
you have a Subversion client (see @uref{http://subversion.tigris.org/}),
you can download the sources using:
@smallexample
% svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk @var{path}
@end smallexample
@noindent
which will put the ESS files into directory @var{path}.  Later,
within that directory, `svn update' will bring that directory up to
date.  Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: @uref{https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk, ESS SVN
site}.  However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the
load when retrieving.

If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you can
then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

@example
(load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el") 
@end example

Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is
