Lecture/Labs 1 and 2 are on For ESS, ESS-Noweb-Sweave.

Lecture/Lab 4 is on parallel computing with R

(each Lecture/Lab was just under 2 hours).  

Comments/corrections welcome, they were used last week here in
Copenhagen, so "most" of the bugs are out.

best,
-tony

p.s. Lecture/Lab 3 needs to be completely redone for WWW work; it
doesn't translate well (some might say, "at all").
