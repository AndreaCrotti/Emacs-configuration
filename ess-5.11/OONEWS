== Changes up to version 5.0 :

* Works with XLispStat, R, and S(plus).



== Changes up to version 4.8.MM6.XE3 :

* inferior S-mode:
	C-c C-a is comint-bol (not attach directories)
	Output cleaned up (thanks to PD).

* Code cleaned up, more according to Emacs-Lisp Style Guide.

* Added some code for S4 (not activated yet). (thanks to JMC).

* Added some extra configuration code (not activated yet) (thanks to MM).

* reports to proper authority (Hornik/Maechler/Rossini).

* Makefile updated (i.e. Unpacks into a subdirectory (this has been
  true for all XE versions, etc)).

* Fixed up output from R (KH).



== Changes up to version 4.8.MM6.XE2 :

* Works with Emacs and XEmacs.  I think.  Documentation needs to be
  updated .



== Changes up to version 4.8.MM6.XE1 :

* XEmacs compatibility added, Emacs compatibility broken.  Easymenu
  now in use.



== Changes up to version 4.8.MM6 :

* Lots of patches by Martin.  S-eval, right? (AJR: I don't know).



== Changes up to version 4.8:

* Keybinding changes in S Transcript Mode.  RET now simply executes
  the current commant.  M-RET executes and moves, C-c RET copies,
  leaving you in the process buffer.  These bindings mirror those in
  Inferior S mode. 

* If S-source-directory is a lambda expression, it is evaluated with
  the process buffer as the current buffer.

* The default starting directory is always your home directory.  Set
  S-directory to `nil' to get the old behaviour (use the current
  buffer's default directory).

* In Inferior S mode, S mode and S transcript mode, M-? is now bound
  to the new function S-list-object-completions.  Also, S-resynch is
  available from the Inf-S menu.

* S-request-a-process is now bound to C-c C-k.  This frees C-c C-p for
  the standard comint binding of comint-previous-prompt.

* Massive manual update.



== Changes in version 4.7:

* Probably *only* works with Emacs 19.29

* New semantics for S-keep-dump-files.  Values may be nil, check, ask
  or t; the default is 'check.  It's also now buffer-local.  See the
  info file for more details.

* New hook, S-post-run-hook, run just after the S process starts.  Use
  this to evaluate code at the start of a session.



== Changes in version 4.6:

* Works with Emacs 19.29

* Font-lock support in S-mode, inferior-S-mode and S-transcript-mode buffers

* M-RET in inferior-S-mode is bound to S-transcript-send-command-and-move

* S-site now much more lightweight to load.



== Changes in version 4.5:

* New, and hopefully simpler, installation procedure.



== Changes in version 4.4:

* There is now a command to send bug reports: S-submit-bug-report.  It
  is also available from menus (Send bug report).

* Keybinding changes: S-view-at-bottom (on C-c C-v) has been deleted.
  It's functionality is provided by comint's
  comint-show-maximum-output, on C-c C-e.  S-display-help-on-object
  has moved from C-c C-h onto C-c C-v (and now has an alias, M-x
  S-help), and S-execute (S-execute-in-tb in S-mode) has moved from
  C-c C-e to C-c C-t.



== Changes in version 4.3:

* The variable S-source-directory-generator has been deleted.  It's
  functionality has been subsumed into the variable
  S-source-directory; if this is not a string it is assumed to be a
  lambda expression, and behaves in the same was as S-source-directory
  used to.

* New user option S-delete-dump-files.



== Changes in version 4.2:

* New user variable S-inf-filenames-map.  Set this to nil if you are
  using DOS or some other system with limited filename lengths.

* S-local-variables-string and S-temp-buffer-p have been deleted.
  S-mode no longer adds a local variables section to source files.
  You should use file extensions to set the major mode.

* S-insert-function-templates has been deleted. Its functionality has
  been taken over by the user variable S-function-template.

* S.el has been divided into four separate files, with autoloads.

* New file S-site.el for site-level customizations.

* S-ask-about-display and X-displays-list have been removed.

* User variable: S-ask-about-transfile. If non-nil, asks for a
  transcript file to use.



== Changes in version 4.0:

* The TAB key in inferior-S-mode is more versatile; it completes S
  object names when point follows an object name, and completes
  filenames when point is in a string.

* New mode: S-transcript-mode, for dealing with S transcript files.

* Multi-line inputs are now evaluated neatly

* inferior-S-prompt is no longer a user variable. Instead, set
  inferior-S-primary-prompt and inferior-S-secondary-prompt

* Uses the comint.el supplied with Emacs 19.20 onwards. 

* Hook: S-send-input-hook

* Emacs version 18 is no longer supported (sorry).  Works with Emacs
  19 (and, unfortunately, only Emacs 19)

* S-tek is no longer supported, and has been removed from the
  distribution

* Works with S version 3.1



== Changes in version 3.5:

* Support for multiple S processes.  Pass a numeric argument to M-x S
  to start a new S process.  The name of the process associated with
  the cuurent buffer is shown in the mode line like this: [S2]

* In the process buffer, a paragraph is a prompt, a command and its
  output, to make the paragraph functions useful.  Multiple S sessions
  are delimited by ^L, to make the page functions useful

* User variable S-synchronize-evals

* New function S-request-a-process, bound to C-c C-p

* New function S-clean-region



== RELEASE 3.4 INFORMATION

* Works with version 3.0 S

* Command-line completion of S object names

* Recognition of attached data frames 

* Dedicated S Help mode

* Tek graphics support

* Several bugfixes and code cleanups

* Texinfo documentation



== RELEASE 2.1 INFORMATION

Improvements since last release (unnumbered of Summer 1990):

* Better description provided of functions loaded.

* Better header for this file.

* S-directory is now a prescriptive rather than just 
  descriptive variable.  

* better syntax table, so |#; are better recognized and
  commands using them work better.

* we have a version number.
