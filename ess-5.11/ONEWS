Changes/New Features in 5.2.12:
        * ESS[SAS]: `M-;' fixed, but the XEmacs function `comment-dwim'
          may be broken, if so, use `M-x comment-region' and `M-x
          uncomment-region' instead; only valid PROCs are fontified
          which is very helpful finding syntax errors (currently
          supported: BASE, ETS, FSP, GRAPH, IML, INSIGHT and STAT); the
          "feature" where `F'-keys take you to an empty buffer when the
          requested destination is a file that does not exist has been
          fixed, now the request results in a no-op.  Further, sas-mode
          now also works in simple terminals.

        * Rterm/Cygwin combination works under Microsoft Windows.

        * ESS[R]: internal calls use baseenv() instead of NULL and
          define 'baseenv' where needed.

        * New experimental support for installing ESS.  See the file
          `lisp/ess-install.el'.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.11:
        * ESS Info entry and `dir' handled more effectively for GNU
          Emacs users

        * ESS[SAS]: temporary files created for batch submission of a
          region are now named based on the current file; see
          `ess-sas-file-root' for details; all `lag' and `dif'
          functions now fontified correctly

        * iESS[SAS]: fixed a few nagging bugs, however, still does not
          appear to work at this time; please let us know if you have
          any ideas.

        * ESS[S]: Support for running other versions of Splus has been
          added for unix.  Two new variables, `ess-s-versions' and
          `ess-s-versions-list', are used to tell ESS what other
          versions of Splus you would like to run.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.10:
        * ESS[R]: ess-r-versions can no longer be customized (since the
          customization was not taking effect unless customizations
          were loaded before ESS).  Its value has been changed so that
          it will also find R executables beginning "R-devel" and
          "R-patched".  If you wish to change this variable, it must be
          set in your `.emacs' before ESS is loaded.

        * Installation with GNU Make enhanced:  unix and unix-like
          operating systems will now be able to install ESS for all
          users in either a GNU Emacs site-lisp or an XEmacs package
          configuration by editing `lisp/ess-site.el' and `Makeconf'
          accordingly, then issuing `make install'

        * ESS[S]: Filename completion (inside strings) now also works in
          XEmacs for R and S-plus.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.9:
        * ESS[R] for Windows:  the \ directory character bug with
          respect to ess-load-file has been eradicated.

        * iESS[SAS]: `C-c C-r' and `C-c C-b' once again work as
          intended and documented.

        * ESS[S]: M-x ess-fix-EQ-assign is a bit more agressive.

        * ESS[S]: Imenu now also shows setAs(), etc.

        * ESS[R]: R function pattern enhanced with underlying code such
          that  `M-C-a' (`ess-beginning-of-function') etc now work for
          many more  cases, including S4 method definitions.

        * iESS[R]: myOwnhelp(1) no longer wrongly triggers help(1).

        * ESS[R]: Improved detection of bogus help buffers: valid help
          buffers containing with the string "no documentation"(e.g.
          contour)  were being treated as bogus.

        * ESS[R]: In R help buffers, if
          `options("help.try.all.packages" =  TRUE)' then `?rlm' will
          list which packages rlm is defined in.  This help  buffer is
          not bogus, but instead is now relabelled "*help[R](rlm in
          packages)*".

        * ESS[STA]: add "//" as comment starting character to
          syntax-table.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.8:
        * iESS: [Tab] completes *file* names "inside string" as in
          earlier (<= 5.2.3) ESS versions.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.7:
        * If you use Custom to change the variable ess-toolbar-items,
          the new toolbar is used in all subsequent ESS buffers.

        * ESS[SAS]: new feature:  if ess-sas-log-max >0 and your .log
          grows to more than ess-sas-log-max bytes, just the first
          ess-sas-log-max bytes are refreshed; this is helpful when
          your .sas program generates lots of error messages and gets
          too big for emacs to display

        * ESS[R/S]: `M-;' in R/S editing modes will now indent with
          either one or two hashes depending on context.

        * ESS[R]: David Whiting's Sweave extensions (to 'noweb') are
          now available (from ess-swv.el loaded by default).

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.6:
        * Removed non-ASCII characters in a few files.

        * ESS[R]: now works better when UTF-8 locale is active; in
          particular, you get correct directional quotes in R's startup
          message  for R-devel (unstable development version of R
          2.1.0) when using  environment variables LANGUAGE=en@quot
          LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

        * ESS[SAS]: toggling of .log mode improved (`F10'); toggling of
          .lst mode now also available (`C-F10'); killing all buffers
          associated with .sas program no longer bound to `C-F10' since
          its a bit overzealous.

        * S-Plus 7 for Windows is now recognized.

        * ESS[S] (incl. R): in auto-fill mode, strings are not wrapped
          anymore.

        * ESS[S] (incl. R): font-lock now correctly differs between R
          and S, e.g., for "_"; both now fontify warning(.) and S does
          terminate() additionally.

        * Support for `bell' aka `beep' aka `ding' aka `alarm' in all
          inferior modes: When \a is output "to the the console" at the
          beginning of a line, the bell is rung.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.5:
        * ESS[R]: `C-c C-q' or `Quit S' from the menu now should work
          (again and less klunkily) and do not append `-exited' to the
          buffer name.  Further, the behavior of `(ess-cleanup)',
          called from ess-quit, now depends on the new customizable
          variable `ess-S-quit-kill-buffers-p' which defaults to `nil'.
          Consequently, the question _"Delete all buffers associated
          with ..?"_ will not be asked anymore by default.

        * ESS[SAS] - ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace will now
          work with the `recode' application as well which is available
          on many platforms

        * ESS[S] (incl. R): Name completion for slots of S4 objects now
          works!

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.4:
        * The documentation now includes an overview of how to use the
          emacs TAGS facility for S functions.  (The distribution also
          used to contain a directory `etc/other/Tags' where a ~1990
          version of `etags.c' was distributed; this is no longer
          relevant and so has been deleted.)

        * ESS[SAS] - When you are working with EBCDIC files on an ASCII
          platform, .log NOTEs may display as gibberish since the EBCDIC
          characters are not converted to ASCII prior to their display.
          So, the function ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace is
          provided for convenience and is bound to `C-F11'.  This
          function requires the `dd' command (only available on unix or
          unix-like platforms).

        * ESS: Completion of object names is now always done
          dynamically rather than allowing the option of using a
          pre-computed database (by `ess-create-object-name-db') since
          modern computers seem fast enough for dynamic completion.
          (We expect few users, if any, have been using the
          pre-computed database method.)

        * ESS: object completion in iESS buffers running on Windows was
          very slow (for GNU Emacs, but not XEmacs) and has now been
          fixed.  Further, it was more or less broken for all versions
          of S-plus 6.x, and has been fixed to work everywhere but with
          the Windows' GUI of S-plus.  The list of objects now shows
          unique names also when an object appears more than once in
          the search path.

        * ESS[R]: Completion of object names now also includes those
          starting with ".".

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.3:
        * ESS: When new inferior ESS processes are created, by default
          they will replace the current buffer (this restores behavior
          from pre 5.2.0). If you wish new ESS processes to start in
          another window of the current frame, set
          inferior-ess-same-window to nil.

        * New variables inferior-Splus-args and inferior-R-args provide
          a way to pass command line arguments to starting S and R
          processes.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
        * bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc.

        * ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list
          if ess-info not found by info

        * ESS[R]: If you have other versions of R on your exec-path,
          such as "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows, ESS
          will find them and create appropriate functions, such as `M-x
          R-1.8.1' or `M-x rw1081', for calling them.  By default only
          Unix programs beginning "R-1" and "R-2" and Windows programs
          parallel to the version of R in your exec-path will be found,
          but see ess-r-versions and ess-rterm-versions for ways to
          find other versions of R.

        * ESS[R]: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and
          "rw1081" on Windows, are added to the "ESS / Start Process /
          Other" menu.

        * ESS[S]: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows
          computer, such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find
          them and create appropriate functions, such as `M-x splus61',
          for calling the console version (Sqpe) inside an emacs
          buffer.  By default only programs installed in the default
          location will be found, but see ess-SHOME-versions for ways
          to find other versions of S-Plus.

        * ESS[S]: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61",
          are added to the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.

        * ESS[R]: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to `C-c C-q') should now
          quit the inferior R process, when issued from either the
          inferior buffer, or from a .R buffer.

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
        * ESS[S] (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support with icons to
          evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch there.
          This code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs
          issues get resolved. The toolbar should be enabled if your
          Emacs displays images, but can be disabled with the variable
          ess-use-toolbar.  Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for
          the S-plus logo.

        * ESS[SAS]: ess-sas-graph-view (`F12') enhanced; you can specify
          external file viewers for each graphics file type via the
          alist ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now
          handled by image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by
          graphics primitives as before

     Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
        * ESS[BUGS]:  new info documentation!  now supports interactive
          processing thanks to Aki Vehtari (mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi);
          new architecture-independent unix support as well as support
          for BUGS v. 0.5

        * ESS[SAS]:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript; info
          documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes; SAS/IML
          statements/functions now highlighted; files edited remotely
          by ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing SUBMIT
          opens a buffer on the remote host via the local variable
          ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh";
          changed the definition of the variable
          ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle to boolean rather than 0/1; added
          the function ess-electric-run-semicolon which automatically
          reverse indents lines containing only "run;"; `C-F1' creates
          MS RTF portrait from the current buffer; `C-F2' creates MS
          RTF landscape from the current buffer; `C-F9' opens a SAS
          DATASET with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW; "inferior"
          aliases for SAS batch:  `C-c C-r' for submit region, `C-c
          C-b' for submit buffer, `C-c C-x' for goto .log; `C-c C-y'
          for goto .lst

        * ESS[S]: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " <- " (as
          before); pressing underscore twice inserts a literal
          underscore.  To stop this smart behaviour, add
          "(ess-toggle-underscore nil)" to your .emacs after ess-site
          has been loaded; ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!)
          now can be customized successfully (for S language dialects);
          Support for Imenu has been improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to
          non-nil to get an "Imenu-S" item on your menubar; ess-help:
          Now using nice underlines (instead of `nuke-* ^H_')

        * ESS[R]:  After (require 'essa-r), `M-x ess-r-var' allows to
          load numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R*
          process; `M-x ess-rdired' gives a "directory editor" of R
          objects; fixed ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e. .Last.value
          bug (thanks to David Brahm)

        * ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to
          ESS.  Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated
          frames by setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help
          buffers can also open in new frames; see the documentation
          for ess-help-own-frame for details.  (Thanks to Kevin Rodgers
          for contributing code.)

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:
        * The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:
        * Minor more Makefile clean up.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
        * Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML documentation are
          also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
          on the web as well; see ESS web page
          (http://ess.r-project.org/) and StatLib
          (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc)

        * Now that info documentation is available, the README.* files
          are no longer supported.  However, they are still distributed
          for what it's worth.

        * ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See XEmacs Installation HOWTO
          (http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html) for details
          (specifically, items 10-15).

        * ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote SAS
          batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
          function key features now supported).  Multiple shells now
          supported so you can run SAS on different computers from
          different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
          ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.

        * Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
        * ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help
          for SAS; `F12' opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
          either within emacs, when available, or via an external
          viewer; more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements
          for remote SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for
          remote SAS interactive jobs, see ess-remote

        * ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for
          the S family

        * Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files made by
          doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
        * New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).  The
          S program can determine the environment in which it is
          currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
          when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other
          specific values for S language processes that ESS does not
          start.

        * New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
          User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
          menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.  This
          feature is still under development.

        * GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &
          BUGS), (some from Stephen Eglen).

        * XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

        * XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

        * Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

        * should now work even when imenu is not available (for old
          XEmacsen).

        * ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; `C-TAB' is globalized along with
          your function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify
          your SAS library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for
          ess-sas-data-view with SAS code placed in the variable
          ess-sas-data-view-libname, also the dataset name is defaulted
          to the nearest permanent dataset to point; Speedbar support
          now works for permanent datasets, please ignore first./last.;
          new font-locking is now the default with more improvements
          for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
          comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with `F10' which will
          font-lock your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas
          files accessed with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is
          experimental) by setting ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh;
          ess-sas-submit-command and ess-sas-submit-command-options are
          buffer-local so you can have local file variable sections at
          the end of your .sas files to request different executables
          or specify special options and the local file variables are
          re-read at submit instead of only at file open so that if you
          make a change it is picked up immediately;

        * ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

        * for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

        * for Rd mode: `C-c C-v' and `switch-process' in menu.
          further, `C-c C-f' prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or
          surrounding a word by things such as \code{.},
          \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.

        * new functions (ess-directory-function) and
          (ess-narrow-to-defun) ess-directory <-> default-directory
          logic (Jeff Mincy).

        * Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
        * S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger
          (Windows))

        * New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)
          Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and
          .log are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension
          collisions).  Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic"
          generation of data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const
          N=" from your data file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.
          Activated by pressing `F12'.

        * Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

        * You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS
          function-key definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)

        * `C-Submit' a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney
          Sparapani)

        * New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)
          To get the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to
          nil.  Also available in .log files via `F10'.

        * Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via `F9' (Rodney
          Sparapani) You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas
          for it to work.

        * User-friendly defaults for `sas-program',
          `ess-sas-batch-pre-command' and `ess-sas-batch-post-command'
          as well Customize support for these and other ESS[SAS]
          variables (Rodney Sparapani)

        * `ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via `F11' (Rodney
          Sparapani)

        * Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in
          ess-emcs.el

        * defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff
          Mincy)

        * Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in
          `README'.

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
        * New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by
          default.  Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " <- "),
          unless inside string and comments where plain "_" is used
          instead. (MM)

        * Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
        * Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger)

        * removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
          sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need
          to fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini)

        * Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)

        * addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide `M-x
          ess-add-MM-keys' a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign',
          typically " <- ", but customizable. (MMaechler)

     Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
        * able to use inferior iESS mode to communicate directly with a
          running S-Plus 4.x process using the Microsoft DDE protocol.
          We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) `C-c C-n' and related key
          sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the inferior
          S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
          and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript
          mode.  All three modes know the S language, syntax, and
          indentation patterns and provide the syntactic highlighting
          that eases the programming tasks.
