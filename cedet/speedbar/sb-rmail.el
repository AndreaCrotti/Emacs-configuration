;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   Speedbar provides a frame in which files, and locations in
;; files are displayed.  These functions provide rmail specific support,
;; showing links and addresses in the side-bar.
;;
;;   To enable in emacs 20.2 or earlier, add this to your .emacs file.
;;   (autoload 'rmail-speedbar-buttons "sb-rmail"
;;             "Rmail specific speedbar button generator.")

;;   This file requires speedbar.

;;; Change log:
;; 0.1   - first revision copied from speedbspec.el V 0.1.1
;; 0.1.1 - removed require speedbspec.
;; 0.1.2 - Changed to handle new keymap feature.

browsing, and moving of messages.")
