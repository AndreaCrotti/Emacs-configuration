;; This small add-on to speedbar provides an alternate way to view ANT
;; project files. It simply lists all the available targets.
;;
;; This code is a simple modification of sb-html.el which comes
;; with speedbar.

;; Installation procedure:
;;
;;   Install speedbar 0.12 or later.
;;   Add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;   (eval-after-load "speedbar" '(load-library "sb-ant"))
;;

;;; Code:

(require 'speedbar)
(require 'sb-texinfo)	; for speedbar-format-texinfo-list

;; Attach these new functions to handle texinfo-mode.
(add-to-list 'speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list
	     '(speedbar-fetch-dynamic-ant-project . speedbar-insert-ant-project-list))

;; This returns t if the major mode of the current buffer is not
;; 'xml-mode. If it is 'xml-mode, then this returns a
;; list where each element is (LEVEL TARGETNAME . MARKER). 
;; LEVLE is always 0,  NAME is the name of the target. MARKER is
;; emacs marker that points to the beginning of the section. The
;; elements in the list returned are in ascending order of the
;; MARKER. This function along with it's parter,
;; speedbar-insert-ant-project-list, are designed to be added to the
;; speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list list.
;;
;; This function is based on `speedbar-fetch-dynamic-html'.
