;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The QuickPeek base classes form the base line for displaying, and
;; managing custom completion systems for any language.  To support an
;; arbitrary file, inherit from `quickpeek-default'.  To support a
;; language, inherit from `quickpeek-language', and override those
;; elements needed.  If you language supports the Semantic Bovinator,
;; inherit instead from `quickpeek-semantic', which in turn inherits
;; from `quickpeek-language.'
