;;; Commentary:
;;   Many new IDEs provide a tree of some structure-or-other to express the
;; structural organization of data.  This is a feature lacking in Emacs,
;; and this is some code to provide that functionality.
;;
;;  The interactive command `tree-test-it-all' will display a demo tree,
;; and `directory-tree-thing' will display a directory hierarchy from
;; the default directory of the current buffer.
;;
;; You can access general tree commands to play with this mode using
;; the functions:
;; tree-test-it-all  - bogus data that lets you see how tree-mode works
;; eieio-class-tree  - show all currently defined eieio classes and
;;                     their current inheritance organization
;; directory-tree-thing - Draw a tree corresponding to the current
;;                     directory.
;; 
;; In all tree modes:
;; RET & mouse-1
;;       will select a node: usually printing something simple in the
;;       minibuffer.
;; e & mouse-2
;;       will edit a node: bring up a file/directory/editor for that
;;       object.
;; x & mouse-3
;;       expand or deflate a node and it's children.  Shrunken nodes
;;       will have elipses `...' in them to indicate that more data
;;       could be expanded.
;;
;; Creating a new tree mode:
;; 1) Look at an example
;; 2) Create a new tree-node class and add whatever slots you need
;; 3) Create a place to make a tree with `tree-new-buffer'
;; 4) Set root of tree ith `tree-set-root'
;; 5) Add nodes ass you see fit with `tree-add-child'
;; 6) Draw the tree with `tree-refresh-tree'
;; 7) Modify select, edit, and change-scope to do whatever you need.
