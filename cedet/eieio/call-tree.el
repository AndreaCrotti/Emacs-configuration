;;; Commentary:
;;   This function allows the user to display a call tree for a
;; given function.  Function symbols are expanded only if they are
;; evaluated Lisp expressions.  Compiled functions and (of course)
;; subroutines are not expanded.  Subroutines are not even listed in
;; the tree as they are assumed to be in there.
;;   This was created in the hopes that it would aid me in debugging
;; things by being able to visualize the flow of control.  As a
;; result, symbols are expanded multiple times, and recursion is
;; removed (and assumed)
;;
