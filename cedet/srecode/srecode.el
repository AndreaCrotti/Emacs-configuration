;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Semantic does the job of converting source code into useful tag
;; information.  The set of `semantic-format-tag' functions has one
;; function that will create a prototype of a tag, which has severe
;; issues of complexity (in the format tag file itself) and inaccuracy
;; (for the purpose of C++ code.)
;;
;; Contemplation of the simplistic problem within the scope of
;; semantic showed that the solution was more complex than could
;; possibly be handled in semantic-format.el.   Semantic Recode, or
;; srecode is a rich API for generating code out of semantic tags, or
;; recoding the tags.
;;
;; See the srecode manual for specific details.
