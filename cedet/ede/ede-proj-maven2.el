;;; Commentary:
;;

;; Notes:

;; - Maven2 is very different from Maven1, so this file wont be
;; useful for Maven1 projects.

;; - Currently the maven2 ede support enables you to open a file in a
;;  maven2 project and build the project with "mvn install".

;; Introduction:

;; Projects that build with Maven2 have a pom.xml file that defines
;; the project.  Maven projects are used for Java projects, and have
;; many differences from Make projects. (Ant is another Java build
;; tool that is more like a Make project.)  With Maven2 you describe a
;; projects dependencies explicitly, and other things like which files
;; to compile is normaly deducted implicitly.

;; Maven2 projects can consist of any file types, but mostly java, xml
;; files(with different file name extensions), and Java property
;; files.

;; Maven2 + Emacs is a good combination, because team members can
;; choose to use Eclipse + Maven2, or Emacs + Maven2, and both can use
;; the workflow their comfortable with.


;; Implementation discussion:

;; Its not totaly clear how ede:s model map on maven2 projects, OTOH,
;; the basic useful functionality is simple:
;; - Identify the project root; the directory where the pom.xml file is
;; - Find source: <proj root>/src/<main|test>/<java|whatever/...
;; - Execute "mvn install" in a project root, to build the project


;;TODO

;;
;; BUG: (this bug-description is somewhat based on a missunderstanding
;; of EDE, FIXME) in projects with a root pom and modules with poms
;; residing in child directories of the root pom, "compile" sometimes
;; build the root project rather than the child project. This is not
;; what we want for maven.  maybe its a feature for makefile projects?

;;to reproduce:
;; - use a hierarchical maven project:
;;root/pom.xml
;;root/A/pom.xml
;;root/B/pom.xml
;; - open root/A/pom.xml, and build with ede. it will build the right project
;; - open root/pom.xml and build
;; - open root/B/pom.xml and ede build. it will build root/pom.xml instead!

;;project-compile-project seems to get the wrong directory to build
;;because ede-compile-project seems to travel up through a project
;;hierarchy and build the root project, rather than the current one.

;;should  ede-parent-project be made generic?

;; In the end more things are desired from proper emacs maven support.

;; - Create new maven2 projects with maven2 from archetypes

;; - Handle maven modules.

;; - make cedet know about the maven project source and class paths.

;; - handle maven build profiles.

;; - ede targets == maven goals ?
;; if so, maven projects will have a "install" goal to start with.
;; all files below the maven src dir, will belong to this target.
;; (this will be true also if we add more "targets" like mavens, "compile" goal.)
;; all src files will belong to all maven targets.

;; - an auxilary project file, like ede-simple could be an useful option

(require 'ede)
(require 'cedet-files)

;;; Code:

;; Because there is one root project file, and no sub project files,
