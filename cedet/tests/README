 * HOW TO RUN CEDET INTEGRATION TESTS *
   ==================================

Run the shell script:

  ./cit-test.sh

Modify this script to specify the Emacs command to use to start Emacs.

Once Emacs is up, do not move the mouse, or produce any other events
for Emacs to read, or the sit-for commands that show the current
output will stall, and you won't be able to see the current state.
