;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides a top level integration test harness for
;; the various CEDET tools to do a simple stand-alone test.
;;
;; The below listed parts DO NOT happen in this order as various
;; tools have to work together to build up the project.
;;
;; Note: Not all entries below are actually tested.  Make in comments the
;; bit a new piece of code implements.
;;
;; Parts:
;;
;; 1) Create an EDE project in /tmp
;;    a build directory tree
;;    b make a toplevel project
;;    c Make a src and include directory
;;    d Put C++ src files into the correct directory.
;;    e Tell EDE where they are.
;;    f create a build file.
;;    g build the sources
;;    g.1 Run a program build by EDE
;;    e remove files from a project.
;;    f shared libraries from EDE.
;;
;; 2) Build sources using SRecode.
;;    a Fill in the constructed C files with classes and methods.
;;    b Test various templates
;;    c Use a template to build some C++ templates
;;    d SRecode to load the new template and construct some sources.
;;    e SRecode map update for local templates.
;;
;; 3) Semantic to parse stuff
;;    a Parse the sources
;;    b Use srecode to make more sources
;;    c test the incremental parsers.
;;    d test the completion engine.
;;    e Save semanticdb tables.  Are the files there?
;;
;; 4) Delete the project
;;    a Make sure the semanticdb cleans up the dead cache files.
;;    b Make sure EDE clears this project from it's project cache.
;;
;; 5) Use COGRE to build sources with SRecode
;;    a Create a COGRE graph.
;;    b Generate C++ code from the graph.
;;    c Compile the sources.
;;
;; 6) Symref
;;    a Attempt to use symref to create a results list.
;;    b open/close entries in symref
;;    c Use 'rename' command to rename and rebuild.
;;    d See if GNU Global is installed
;;    e repeat above.
;;
;; 7) Create a distribution file.
;;    a Call "make dist"
;;    b update the version number
;;    c make a new dist.  Verify version number.
;;    d In a fresh dir, unpack the dist.
;;    e Compile that dist.
;;
;; 8) Try out some external database tools
;;    a GNU Global
;;    b CScope
;;    c idutils
