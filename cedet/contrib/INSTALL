Installation Instruction for the CONTRIB directory

This is a list of the different contributed tools that work with CEDET
and what they do, and any specific install instructions needed to use them.

These instructions assume that you are using the default CEDET install
methods which will set up most aspects of these contributed files
automatically.

eassist.el:
   Written by Anton V. Belyaev
   Provides a fancy way to navigate to tags similar to VisualAssist.

   To use, add something like this to your .emacs file:

   (defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
     (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "M-o") 'eassist-switch-h-cpp)
     (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "M-m") 'eassist-list-methods))
   (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)

   To check out how it works, do the following:

   1) Open any C++ file with class definithion, press M-m. Try to type
      any method name.

   2) Open any .cpp file. Press M-o. If there is .h or .hpp file in the
      same folder, it will be opened.
