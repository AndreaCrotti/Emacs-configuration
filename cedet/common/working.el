;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Working lets Emacs Lisp programmers easily display working messages.
;; These messages typically come in the form of a percentile, or generic
;; doodles if a maximum is unknown.
;;
;; The working entry points are quite simple.  If you have a loop that needs
;; to display a status as it goes along, it would look like this:
;;
;;  (working-status-forms "Doing stuff" "done"
;;    (while condition
;;  	(working-status (calc-percentile))
;;  	(my-work))
;;    (working-status t))
;;
;; If you cannot calculate a percentile, use the function
;; `working-dynamic-status' instead, and pass in what you know.  For
;; both status printing functions, the first argument is optional,
;; and you may pass in additional arguments as `format' elements
;; to the first argument of `working-status-forms'.
;;
;; See the examples at the end of the buffer.

;;; Backwards Compatibility:
;;
;; If you want to use working in your program, but don't want to force people
;; to install working, use could add this at the beginning of your program for
;; compatibility.

;;; History:
;; 
;; 1.0 First Version
;;
;; 1.1 Working messages are no longer logged.
;;     Added a generic animation display funciton:
;;        Convert celeron to animator
;;        Added a bounce display
;;     Made working robust under a multi-frame environment (speedbar)
;;
;; 1.2 Fix up documentation.
;;     Updated dotgrowth function for exceptionally large numbers of dots.
;;     Added the percentage bubble displays.
;;
;; 1.3 Added `working-status-timeout' and `working-status-call-process'.
;;     Added test fns `working-wait-for-keypress' and `working-verify-sleep'.
;;
;; 1.4 ???
;;
;; 1.5 Use features from the fame library.
