;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Some aspects of EDEBUG are not extensible.  It is possible to extend
;; edebug through other means, such as alias or advice, but those don't stack
;; very well when there are multiple tools trying to do the same sort of thing.
;;
;; This package provides a way to extend some aspects of edebug, such as value
;; printing.
