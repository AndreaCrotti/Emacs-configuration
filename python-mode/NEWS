Python Mode News
================

New in version 5.2.1
--------------------

- Syntax highlight as a keyword "lambda:" just like "lambda x:".  Given by Dan
  Davison.
- Add "python3" as a key for python-mode in interpreter-mode-alist and
  auto-mode-alist.

New in version 5.2.0
--------------------

- Fixed filling of triple-quoted strings.

- Add new font-lock faces for class names and exception names.

- Do not fill when calling fill-paragraph with point in a region of code.

- Fixed font-locking of exception names in parenthesized lists.

- Fixed font-locking of decorators with arguments.

- Fixed font-locking of triple-quoted strings; single quotes appearing in
  triple-quoted strings no longer upset font-locking.

- Fixed the stack-entry regexp used by pdbtrack so that it now works with
  module-level frames.

- Do not bind C-c C-h; `py-help-at-point' is now on C-c C-e by default.

- hide-show mode is now supported.

- When shifting regions right and left, keep the region active in Emacs.
