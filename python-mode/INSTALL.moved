No special installing is required to get the basics, just make
sure python-mode.el gets evaluated.

To evaluate python-mode.el when Emacs starts put something like
the following into your init file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "MY-PATH-TO-PYTHON-MODE")
(require 'python-mode)

Or get the file loaded like this:

(load "MY-PATH-TO-PYTHON-MODE/python-mode.el")

Customizing `py-set-load-path' is needed only when extended
features from subdirectories shall be used - a section under
construction for the moment.
