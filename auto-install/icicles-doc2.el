;;  Icicles documentation, part 2.
;;
;;  Files `icicles-doc1.el' and `icicles-doc2.el' contain the doc for
;;  Icicles, including how to install and use Icicles.  You can also
;;  read the Icicles doc, in formatted form, on the Emacs-Wiki Web
;;  site: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.  Emacs Wiki
;;  also has a few addtional pages about Icicles.  In particular, if
;;  you are new to Emacs, as well as Icicles, see this page:
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNewbieWithIcicles.
;;
;;  This file continues the Icicles documentation, which starts in
;;  file `icicles-doc1.el'.

;;
;;  If you have library `linkd.el' and Emacs 22 or later, load
;;  `linkd.el' and turn on `linkd-mode' now.  It lets you easily
;;  navigate around the sections of this doc.  Linkd mode will
;;  highlight this Index and render it more readable.  Likewise, for
;;  the cross-references and section headings throughout this file.
;;  You can get `linkd.el' here:

;;(@* "Introduction: On Beyond Occur...")
;;  ** Introduction: On Beyond Occur... **
;;
;;  You've no doubt used standard Emacs command `occur'.  It finds all
;;  lines in a buffer that match a regexp that you enter.  It displays
;;  the matching lines as links in buffer *Occur* - you can click a
;;  link to navigate to the corresponding line in the original buffer.
;;  Using buffer *Occur* is similar to using the output of the Emacs
;;  `grep' command.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-occur' is similar to `occur', but instead of
;;  entering a regexp (with `RET') you type a regexp and then use
;;  `S-TAB' to show the matching lines in buffer `*Completions*'.  As
;;  usual in Icicles, you can complete to a single candidate, or cycle
;;  among candidates to choose one.  To navigate to a match in the
;;  original buffer, use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', or `C-prior'.
;;  One advantage of `icicle-occur' over `occur' is that you can
;;  change the regexp on the fly to match different sets of lines.
;;
;;  Another, major advantage is that you can use progressive
;;  completion to find lines that match multiple regexps.  A similar,
;;  but less interactive, effect can be had using chained `grep'
;;  commands, but it is otherwise not possible with other search
;;  methods such as regexp Isearch.  A regexp simply cannot express
;;  intersection ("and") except in the limited form of "followed by".
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' is a generalization of `icicle-occur'.
;;  You enter an initial, search-context regexp (using `RET'), which
;;  defines a set of completion candidates: all of the matching
;;  strings in the current buffer (by default).  These candidates are
;;  called "search contexts".
;;
;;  Command `icicle-occur' is really `icicle-search' with an implicit
;;  initial regexp of `.*' (which you do not enter, however).  That
;;  is, the initial completion candidates for `icicle-occur' are all
;;  of the lines of the buffer (`.' matches any character except a
;;  newline).
;;
;;  With `icicle-search', the candidates need not be single, complete
;;  lines; they can be any strings in the buffer, including multi-line
;;  strings.  Your initial regexp is used over and over to find the
;;  set of matching strings in the region or buffer that you search.
;;  These strings then serve as the completion candidates.
;;
;;  For example, you might use a search-context regexp of
;;  "[A-Z][^.?!]+[.?!]" to search sentences, "\\(.+\n\\)+" to search
;;  paragraphs, or "\\([^\f]*[\f]\\|[^\f]+$\\)" to search pages.
;;  (That's in fact how convenience commands
;;  `icicles-search-sentences', `icicles-search-paragraphs', and
;;  `icicles-search-pages' are defined.)
;;
;;  `\f' is the form-feed, or page-separator, character.  You input
;;  `\f', `\t', and `\n' using `C-q l', `C-q TAB', and `C-j',
;;  respectively.  See (@> "Dots, Dots, Dots") for information about
;;  multi-line dot (`.'), which matches also newline.
;;
;;  Again, you can use progressive completion (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to
;;  match several different regexps within the same page or the same
;;  sentence.  For example, you could find all sentences that contain
;;  `character', `delete', and `backward', in any order, as follows:
;;
;;    C-c ` [A-Z][^.?!]+[.?!] RET
;;    character M-* delete M-* backward
;;
;;  When you visit a search context, both `icicle-occur' and
;;  `icicle-search' highlight that hit.  For `icicle-occur', the
;;  search context is the current line.  For `icicle-search', it is
;;  whatever your search-context regexp matches.
;;
;;(@* "How Icicles Search Works")
;;  ** How Icicles Search Works **
;;
;;  There are several Icicles search commands, some of which are bound
;;  to keys in Icicle mode:
;;
;;  `C-c '',  `icicle-occur' - An `occur' with icompletion.
;;  `C-c `'   `icicle-search' - Seach buffer areas that match regexp.
;;            `icicle-search-buffer' (`C-1')- Search selected buffers.
;;            `icicle-search-file' (`C--') - Search selected files.
;;            `icicle-search-bookmarks-together' (`C-u'),
;;            `icicle-search-bookmark' - Search bookmarks.
;;  `C-c $'   `icicle-search-word' - Search for a whole word.
;;  `C-c ^'   `icicle-search-keywords' - Search with regexp keywords.
;;  `C-c `'   `icicle-compilation-search' - Search compilation hits
;;                                          (e.g `grep' hits).
;;  `C-c "'   ["] `icicle-search-text-property' -
;;               Search for a given text property value.
;;  `C-c ='   `icicle-imenu' - Navigate among Imenu entries.
;;            `icicle-imenu-command' -
;;               Navigate among Emacs command definitions.
;;            `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function' -
;;               Navigate among Emacs non-interactive function
;;               definitions.
;;  `C-c TAB' `icicle-comint-command' - Retrieve a past shell command.
;;
;;  All operate in the same general way:
;;
;;  1. Unlike standard incremental search, Icicles search commands
;;     search the entire buffer, not just the part that follows the
;;     cursor.  If the region is active, however, then the search is
;;     confined to the region.  Some Icicles search commands let you
;;     search across multiple buffers, multiple files, or multiple
;;     bookmarks, including region bookmarks.  Searching within one or
;;     more such regions of text is a first way to limit the context
;;     of a search.
;;
;;  2. You limit the search context in a second way, by providing some
;;     information, such as a regexp or a character property (text or
;;     overlay property), that defines zones of text that you want to
;;     search.  You can use (lax) completion against previous input to
;;     enter the regexp or the character property.  In some cases, the
;;     information (e.g. regexp) to define the search context is
;;     provided automatically by the search command; for example,
;;     `icicle-occur' assumes that you want to search lines.
;;
;;  3. If you use a regexp to define the search context, and if that
;;     regexp has subgroups, that is, subexpressions of the form
;;     `\(...\)', then you are prompted for the subgroup to use to
;;     define the search context.  0 means the entire regexp match is
;;     used as a context.  1 means that whatever the first subgroup
;;     matches is used as a context, and so on.
;;
;;     Using a subgroup thus limits the search context in a third way.
;;     It lets you find a search match within a larger search-match
;;     context.  For example, you might choose a Lisp argument list as
;;     the search context, specifying that it must follow `(defun ':
;;     `(defun [^(]*\(([^(]*)\)'.  Subgroup 1 is the argument list.
;;     Specifying a subgroup search context helps you become more
;;     familiar with regexps.  Icicles search highlighting (see below)
;;     shows you the subgroup matches instantly.
;;
;;  4. You can limit the set of search contexts in a fourth way, by
;;     using `M-&' to provide predicates that search-context
;;     candidates must satisfy.  Command `icicle-search' and its
;;     derivative functions use candidates of the form (CONTEXT
;;     . MARKER), where CONTEXT is a string, the search hit (search
;;     context), and MARKER is a buffer marker that locates the
;;     CONTEXT.  Predicates you supply to the `M-&' prompt must expect
;;     such candidates.  Only contexts that satisfy the predicate are
;;     found.  For example, if the predicate is (lambda (x) (commandp
;;     (intern-soft (car x)))), then only contexts that name Emacs
;;     commands are found.  Or, if you have a predicate `verbp' that
;;     tests whether a word is an English verb form, then you can use
;;     that to limit word matches to verbs.  In this way, you can
;;     combine purely syntactic searching (regexp or text-property
;;     match) with more semantic search criteria.  After building up a
;;     complex predicate by using `M-&', you can save it to a variable
;;     with `C-M-&' and then reuse it later with `C-='.  In addition
;;     to, or instead of, using `M-&', you can set user option
;;     `icicle-search-context-match-predicate' to a predicate that
;;     takes a CONTEXT as argument (the match string only, no MARKER).
;;     See also (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Progressive Completion").
;;
;;  5. Icicles finds all of the qualified search contexts, and
;;     presents them to you as completion candidates.  As always for
;;     Icicles completion, the number of search hits (matching
;;     candidates), is displayed in the mode-line of buffer
;;     `*Completions*' - e.g., `72 candidates'.
;;
;;  6. You can navigate among the source-buffer search contexts, using
;;     the multi-command action keys (`C-next', `C-prior', `C-RET',
;;     `C-mouse-2').  The contexts are highlighted in the source
;;     buffer(s).
;;
;;  7. As always in Icicles, your current minibuffer input filters the
;;     set of current candidates - the search contexts, so that only
;;     those that contain matches to your input remain as candidates.
;;     This is a second level of matching: looking for a refinement
;;     pattern within the search contexts. And this constitutes a
;;     fifth way you can limit the set of search contexts.
;;
;;  8. As always in Icicles, this input can be a regexp.  This is
;;     ordinary apropos completion, applied to searching.  You don't
;;     type `RET' to enter this regexp, and you can change it on the
;;     fly to change the set of search hits.  Icicles searching is
;;     thus incremental, in the sense that changing your input
;;     dynamically changes the set of matching search hits.  Icicles
;;     searching is not incremental with respect to the initial,
;;     context matching, however.
;;
;;  9. As always in Icicles, you can type some input and then hit
;;     `C-~' to remove all candidates that match that input.  Then
;;     type some other input and hit `C-~' again to remove those
;;     matches.  Or you can use `M-&' to define a predicate, and then
;;     hit `C-~' to remove all candidates that satisfy that predicate.
;;     And so on.  And you can use `S-mouse-2' or the `delete' key to
;;     remove individual search hits.  These techniques let you chip
;;     away at the search set, removing hits that are uninteresting.
;;     This is a very powerful technique for both searching and
;;     search-and-replace (see next), and it constitutes a sixth way
;;     to limit the set of search contexts.  See also
;;     (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Chip Away the Non-Elephant").
;;
;;  10. You can sort the search hits in various ways.  This can
;;     facilitate navigation and comparison of hits, as well as
;;     search-and-replace (see #11).  And you can define your own
;;     Icicles search commands that provide custom search orders for
;;     particular kinds of search.  It is likely that you have never
;;     considered being able to sort search hits, but if you think
;;     about it you will see that this can be handy.  If you are
;;     searching across multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks, sorting
;;     helps you compare, visit, and replace related hits from the
;;     different sources, instead of having to handle all of the hits
;;     from each source in turn.
;;
;;  11. You can replace text while you search, forward, backward, or
;;     randomly.  You can replace entire search contexts or just the
;;     parts that match your current input.  You can use any
;;     replacement string that is allowed by `query-replace-regexp'.
;;     In Emacs 22 or later, this includes `\,', to substitute the
;;     result of a Lisp evaluation.  Use the alternative-action keys
;;     for replacement: `C-S-RET', `C-S-mouse-2', `C-S-next',
;;     `C-S-prior', `C-S-down', and `C-S-up'.  At the first use, you
;;     are prompted for the replacement string; it is used thereafter.
;;     You can use `M-|' (`icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action') to
;;     replace all matches.  See (@> "Search and Replace").
;;
;;  12. When you visit a search context (using `C-mouse-2' or
;;     `C-next', for example), the part of the candidate that matches
;;     your input is highlighted.  An entire search context is
;;     highlighted in face `icicle-search-main-regexp-current', and
;;     the part that matches your input is highlighted in face
;;     `icicle-search-current-input'.  All other search contexts are
;;     also highlighted (in face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others').
;;
;;  13. User option `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;     controls whether the input matches are highlighted within each
;;     search context or only within the current context.  It,
;;     together with `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag',
;;     controls whether the input-match highlighting covers an
;;     expanded common match among all matches or just the exact input
;;     match.
;;
;;  14. If you do not use a subgroup to define the search context (as
;;     in #3, above), that is, if the search context corresponds to
;;     the entire search regexp, then up to eight context levels
;;     (subgroups) are each highlighted differently, using faces
;;     `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;     `icicle-search-context-level-8'.  This context-level
;;     highlighting is not done if user option
;;     `icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag' is nil.
;;
;;  You might have noticed that out of these 14 search features, 6
;;  constitute independent ways in which you can narrow or limit the
;;  set of search hits among which you can navigate.  And another one
;;  (sorting) further facilitates your observation and selection of
;;  search hits.  Restricting the search space and making search-hit
;;  patterns more evident are in fact what search is all about, and
;;  Icicles offers you some unique tools to do this.
;;
;;  For several Icicles search commands, including `icicle-search'
;;  (`C-c `'), you provide an initial regexp to define the search
;;  contexts (step 1, above).  Why use two regexps to search (steps 1
;;  and 4, above)?  To make things simpler.  Regular expressions are
;;  powerful for searching, but they can also be cumbersome sometimes.
;;  Why not use one simple regexp to set up a set of candidates and
;;  then, optionally, use a second simple regexp to filter those
;;  candidates?
;;
;;  This is the same idea as that behind progressive completion.  And
;;  speaking of which, how would you find a line that contains a given
;;  set of words (each of them), but in an arbitrary (unknown) order?
;;  Progressive completion.  Which lines in this doc section contain
;;  the words `which', `you', and `how', in any order?  If you are
;;  reading this doc in file `icicles-doc2.el', then just use
;;  `icicle-occur' with progressive completion:
;;
;;    C-c ' which M-SPC you M-SPC how
;;
;;  That narrows things down to four lines that you can then navigate
;;  among.  Progressive completion gives Icicles search a power boost.
;;
;;  Like `icicle-occur', commands `icicle-search-word' (`C-c $') and
;;  `icicle-search-keywords' (`C-c ^') are variants of `icicle-search'
;;  that differ only in the regexp used.  Each accepts your input and
;;  converts it to a regexp that does the right thing.
;;  `icicle-search-word' just adds `\b' before and after the word you
;;  type, so that it matches at word boundaries.
;;
;;  `icicle-search-keywords' wraps the keywords you provide as input
;;  with regexp grouping (`\(...\)') and alternative (`\|') syntax, so
;;  that search looks for any of the keywords.
;;
;;  "Keywords" here is an understatement. Each keyword is actually a
;;  regexp and is treated as such, unless you use `C-`' to turn on
;;  escaping of regexp special characters.  In that case, each keyword
;;  is matched as a substring.  At the `C-c $' prompt, you can use
;;  completion to choose keywords that you have already entered, or
;;  you can use `C-RET' to enter new keywords.
;;
;;  As a shortcut, you can use the search string during incremental
;;  search (Isearch) as the initial regexp for `icicle-search'.  You
;;  do this by hitting `S-TAB' during Isearch.  This ends Isearch and
;;  passes its search string to `icicle-search'.  This can be a handy
;;  way to start `icicle-search', picking up its search pattern by
;;  using, say, `C-s C-w C-w...'.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Search Multiple Buffers, Files, and Bookmarks")
;;  ** Search Multiple Buffers, Files, and Bookmarks **
;;
;;  If you provide a prefix argument to most Icicles search functions,
;;  then you can search multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks.
;;
;;  * Plain prefix argument (`C-u') - Search multiple bookmarks of
;;    various kinds.  To use this feature, you must also use library
;;    `bookmark+.el'.  See (@> "Icicles Bookmark Enhancements").
;;
;;  * Non-negative numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C-9') - Search
;;    multiple buffers - you are prompted for the buffers to search.
;;    If the prefix argument is 99, then only buffers that are
;;    visiting files are candidates.  You can use `C-RET' and so on to
;;    choose individual buffers with completion.  You can use `C-!' to
;;    choose all buffers or all buffers that match a regexp.
;;    (See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands").)
;;
;;    Note: You can use `M-s i' in Ibuffer or Buffer Menu to search
;;    all marked buffers using Icicles search.  In Ibuffer, menu item
;;    `Icicles Search (and Replace)...' does the same thing as `M-s
;;    i'.
;;
;;  * Negative numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C--') - Search multiple
;;    files in the current directory - you are prompted for the files
;;    to search.  As for multiple-buffer searching, you can use
;;    `C-RET' and so on.
;;
;;    Note: You can use `M-s i' in Dired to search all marked files
;;    using Icicles search.  Menu item `Search (and Replace)...' is
;;    added to the Icicles submenu of menu `Multiple' (or `Operate'),
;;    and it does the same thing as `M-s i'.
;;
;;  As a convenience, some specialized Icicles commands are defined
;;  that correspond to `icicle-search' with the various
;;  prefix-argument cases: `icicle-search-bookmarks-together',
;;  `icicle-search-buffer', and `icicle-search-file'.  If you often
;;  use `C-c `' with one of the prefix argument options, then you
;;  might want to bind one or more of these commands.  These commands
;;  are also available in the Icicles menu-bar menu (or the Search
;;  menu, if it exists).
;;
;;(@* "User Options for Icicles Searching")
;;  ** User Options for Icicles Searching **
;;
;;  You can customize the following user options, to control search
;;  and replacement behavior.
;;
;;  * If `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' is non-nil (the default
;;    value), then, whenever you use a prefix argument, Icicles search
;;    functions annotate each candidate with the name of the buffer
;;    where the search hit occurs, highlighted, to help orient you.
;;    The buffer name is actually part of the (multi-completion)
;;    candidate, so you can match against it.
;;
;;    Note that even when the value of this option is nil, if option
;;    `icicle-help-in-mode-line-flag' is non-nil then you can see the
;;    buffer name in the mode-line (as well as the position and length
;;    of the search context in the buffer).
;;
;;  * Icicles search functions that use an initial regexp highlight
;;    the first `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' matches for that
;;    regexp at once (using face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others').
;;    The effect is similar to the Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting
;;    of Isearch (except that the highlighting is not in fact lazy).
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-nil, then
;;    Icicles search functions highlight your current input match
;;    within *all* search contexts at once.  If it is non-nil and
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag' is also non-nil, then
;;    what is highlighted for each input match is the expanded common
;;    match among all input matches throughout the search area.  If
;;    either is nil, then only the exact input match is highlighted.
;;
;;    For example
;;    (see (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Nutshell View of Icicles")),
;;    if the initial regexp defining the search context is
;;    `.*recursive.*', and your input is `edit', then searching file
;;    `icicles-doc1.el' highlights not `edit' but
;;    ``abort-recursive-edit'', which is the longest common match
;;    among all input matches.
;;
;;    Gotcha: Remember that the expanded common match pertains to the
;;            entire completion candidate.  In the context of Icicles
;;            search, if you are interested in multiple matches of
;;            your input within the same search context, and you want
;;            to be sure to catch each match, then turn off
;;            common-match expansion.
;;
;;            Why?  The search context as a whole is compared with the
;;            other search contexts when looking for the expanded
;;            common match.  Your input is matched against the entire
;;            context (search hit), and the expanded common match is
;;            (typically) the longest match that is common to the
;;            other search contexts.  Do not expect the longest common
;;            match of your input against all occurrences in the
;;            search contexts.  What counts is the longest single
;;            match for a given context.
;;
;;            For example, if your input is `then' and two of the
;;            search hits are `But then X and then Y' and `W and then
;;            Z', the expanded common match will be `and then', not
;;            `then'.  The matches highlighted for your input thus do
;;            not include each occurrence of `then' in the search
;;            hits, but rather each occurrence of `and then'.
;;
;;    If `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag',
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag', and
;;    `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' are all non-nil, then
;;    a search replacement replaces the expanded common match;
;;    otherwise, it replaces only the exact match.
;;
;;    The default value of `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    is nil, because non-nil can impact performance negatively if
;;    there are many search contexts - the highlighting is updated
;;    with each input change.  You can toggle the value at any time
;;    using command `icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to
;;    `C-^' in the minibuffer during Icicles search.
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is non-nil (the default value)
;;    then search highlighting is removed after the search.  If you
;;    set this to nil then you can remove search highlighting manually
;;    later using command `icicle-search-highlight-cleanup'.  You can
;;    toggle this search highlight removal at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', bound to `C-.' in the minibuffer
;;    (except during file-name completion).
;;
;;    One use of nil `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to highlight
;;    regexp matches throughout a region or buffer (or multiple files
;;    or...).  In that capacity, Icicles search functions act like
;;    some of the highlighting commands in my library `highlight.el'.
;;    Note that when `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is nil, *all*
;;    Icicles search highlighting remains: last-visited search
;;    context, other context matches, current-input matches, and even
;;    regexp subgroups.  The faces for these are, respectively:
;;
;;    - `icicle-search-main-regexp-current'
;;    - `icicle-search-main-regexp-others'
;;    - `icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here' (everywhere, if
;;      `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-nil)
;;    - `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;      `icicle-search-context-level-8'
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is nil, then
;;    whatever matches your current input is replaced, within the
;;    current search context, when you perform replacement
;;    (e.g. `C-S-RET').  If the value is non-nil (the default value),
;;    then the entire search context is replaced, instead.  You can
;;    use `C-,' at any time during searching and replacing, to toggle
;;    the value.
;;
;;  * Command `icicle-search-word' (bound to `C-c $') always searches
;;    for a whole word: your initial search string is matched only
;;    against whole words.  Non-nil `icicle-search-whole-word-flag'
;;    makes other Icicles search commands also perform whole-word
;;    searching.  The search string you type is matched literally, but
;;    matches must start and end at word boundaries.  Because it is
;;    matched literally, all regexp special characters in the search
;;    string are escaped.  This means, for instance, that you can
;;    match `foo-bar' as a word, even in contexts (such as Emacs Lisp)
;;    where `-' is not a word-constituent character.  Similarly, you
;;    can match the literal four-character "word" `f.*g'.  You can use
;;    `M-q' while searching to toggle this option; the new value takes
;;    effect for the next complete search.
;;
;;  * You can toggle `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag' at any time using
;;    `M-g' in the minibuffer.  This is handy for multi-commands that
;;    browse, such as Icicles search.  It means that you can use
;;    `next' and so on instead of `C-next' and so on to navigate among
;;    search hits.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;  * `icicle-search-hook': Functions run after searching and moving
;;    to a match, whether by `RET' or `C-RET' (or `C-next' or
;;    `C-prior').
;;
;;  It can sometimes be useful to highlight all regexp matches using a
;;  large value of `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' and a nil value
;;  of `icicle-search-cleanup-flag', and then set
;;  `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' to zero and use an Icicles
;;  search function again with a different regexp to search through
;;  the same region or buffer.  This lets you see the relation between
;;  the two sets of regexp matches.
;;
;;(@* "Using Regexps with Icicles Search")
;;  ** Using Regexps with Icicles Search **
;;
;;  You can use Icicles search to find text entities of a certain kind
;;  - sentences, paragraphs, file names, URLs, and so on.  A
;;  convenient way to do this is to use `C-='
;;  (`icicle-insert-string-from-variable') or `C-x r i'
;;  (`insert-register') in the minibuffer to insert a predefined
;;  regexp that matches a particular kind of text entity.  Which of
;;  these you use depends on whether the regexp string is saved in a
;;  variable (`C-=') or a register (`C-x r i').
;;
;;  For example, suppose you are in a mail client and you want to move
;;  between mail headers.  If you use a regexp that matches the header
;;  field you want (e.g. the sent date or sender) then Icicles search
;;  highlights all such occurrences and lets you navigate among them -
;;  instant mail browser!  Or, suppose you are in a C++ or Perl file
;;  and you want to navigate among function definitions or other
;;  definitions.  If you have a canned regexp that matches the start
;;  of a definition, then you can use `C-=' to quickly turn
;;  `icicle-search' into a code browser.  In a log file, navigate
;;  among date or time entries or IP addresses...  Of course, most
;;  programming modes and mail clients already provide other ways to
;;  navigate, but you get the idea - Icicles search provides a general
;;  way to navigate among things, as long as you can match them with
;;  regexps, and `C-=' lets you quickly access a library of predefined
;;  regexps.
;;
;;  You can find useful regexps to store in variables in the standard
;;  Emacs Lisp libraries.  Grep for `font-lock-keywords' or `regexp'
;;  in the Emacs `lisp' directory and its subdirectories.
;;
;;   See `align.el' for regexps for programming languages.
;;   See `url-dav.el' for regexps matching ISO 8601 dates.
;;   See `rmail.el', `sendmail.el', and `mh-show.el' for regexps
;;   matching mail-header fields.
;;
;;  Imenu regexps occurring as parts of different values of
;;  `imenu-generic-expression' for different buffer types can be used
;;  as variable values for `C-='.  They all work fine with
;;  `icicle-search', turning it into a navigator for the given mode.
;;  See, for example, `generic-x.el' and `lisp-mode.el'.  Here is a
;;  regexp for Javascript function definitions from `generic-x.el':
;;
;;   "^function\\s-+\\([A-Za-z0-9_]+\\)"
;;
;;  And `lisp-imenu-generic-expression' (in `lisp-mode.el') provides
;;  regexps for Lisp function, variable, and type definitions.  Here
;;  is the variable-definition regexp:
;;
;;   "^\\s-*(\\(def\\(c\\(onst\\(ant\\)?\\|ustom\\)\\|ine-symbol-macro
;;   \\|parameter\\|var\\)\\)\\s-+\\(\\(\\sw\\|\\s_\\)+\\)"
;;
;;  You certainly do not want to type a regexp like that into the
;;  minibuffer (and the function-definition regexp is twice as
;;  complex)!  Put it into a variable or register once and use `C-='
;;  or `C-x r i' from then on to retrieve it - simple.
;;
;;  If it's so simple, then why not let a command do it?  This is
;;  exactly what command `icicle-imenu' (bound to `C-c =') does.  You
;;  don't need to bother looking up Imenu regexps and assigning them
;;  to variables for use with `C-=' and `icicle-search'-
;;  `icicle-imenu' does that for you automatically.
;;  See (@> "Other Icicles Search Commands").
;;
;;  In sum: For complete interactivity, type a regexp dynamically as
;;  input to `icicle-search'.  For isolated special regexps that you
;;  use, save them in variables and use `C-=' with `icicle-search'.
;;  For well-defined sets of regexps, especially if used frequently,
;;  define a command that uses `icicle-search'.  There is a spectrum
;;  of use cases for `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' is very general and very powerful.  It
;;  might never replace incremental search - either regexp or literal
;;  string search, but in some cases it can be quite handy.  Think of
;;  it as another tool to add to your search-tool belt.  Admittedly,
;;  it does take a little getting used to.  Remember, in particular,
;;  that the initial, context regexp you enter (with `RET') cannot be
;;  changed without re-executing `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  And remember too that `C-l' (`icicle-retrieve-previous-input') is
;;  your friend - it clears the minibuffer during cycling, retrieving
;;  your last real input.  Use it to modify your second and subsequent
;;  regexps on the fly - those that filter the initial candidate list
;;  further.  You can repeat `C-l' to retrieve older completion
;;  inputs, and you can use `C-S-l' (that is, `C-L') to cycle previous
;;  inputs in the other direction.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  Oh - And don't forget that you can do things like take the
;;  complement of your fine-tuning regexp matches, within the context
;;  of your coarse-tuning matches.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  For example, use `^.*defun.*$' as the main regexp, to find all
;;  lines containing `defun'.  Then type `icicle' to match only the
;;  lines with `defun' that also contain `icicle'.  Then complement
;;  (`C-~') that set, to see the lines that contain `defun' but not
;;  `icicle'.
;;
;;  And you can then save that set of matches, and then subtract it
;;  from another set of matches in a different search...  You get the
;;  idea.  When performing set operations combined with
;;  `icicle-search', keep in mind that the saved set does not include
;;  any position information - it is only a set of matching strings.
;;  So, in particular, a set-union operation (`C-+') is not useful
;;  with `icicle-search' (adding a saved set of strings without
;;  positions is useless).  Still, you can do things like match lines
;;  that contain `defun' followed somewhere by `()', and then subtract
;;  the (saved) set of lines in the same region that contain `icicle'.
;;  Try it in an Icicles library, using regexps `.*icicle.*$' and
;;  `^*.defun.*().*$'.
;;
;;  One more reminder: When you save a set of completion candidates
;;  (`C-M->'), make sure that you actually have a set of candidates to
;;  save!  It is not enough to just enter a regexp at the
;;  `icicle-search' prompt.  You must also use some Icicles command,
;;  such as `TAB', `S-TAB', `next', or `down' to tell Icicles how to
;;  create the candidate set - how to match the regexp.

;;
;;  Search and Replace
;;  ------------------
;;
;;  Replacement during Icicles search is something quite different
;;  from anything you are used to.  There are several different ways
;;  to replace search-hit text during Icicles search, and it can be a
;;  bit of a challenge to understand all the possibilities.  So my
;;  advice is to experiment, as well as to read the descriptions here.
;;
;;  You can replace the current search match by using any of the
;;  alternative action keys: `C-S-RET', `C-S-mouse-2' (in
;;  `*Completions*'), `C-S-next', `C-S-prior', `C-S-down', and
;;  `C-S-up'.  You can use `M-|'
;;  (`icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action') to replace all matches
;;  of your current input at once, throughout the search space.
;;
;;  At the first use of any of these, you are prompted for the
;;  replacement pattern; it is used thereafter, or until you use `M-,'
;;  (`icicle-search-define-replacement').  You can use `M-,' at any
;;  time during searching to change the pattern for subsequent
;;  replacements.  The replacement pattern can be anything that is
;;  allowed as a replacement by `query-replace-regexp'.  In Emacs 22
;;  or later, this includes Lisp sexp evaluation via `\,'.
;;
;;  Unlike `query-replace', you need not visit each search match - you
;;  can visit and replace selected matches in any order.  Some other
;;  differences from standard `query-replace' and
;;  `query-replace-regexp':
;;
;;   * Replacing matches of your current input provides a contextual
;;     replacement feature: replace `foo' by `fu', but only in zones
;;     that match `toto.*titi'.
;;
;;   * Icicles search navigation (`C-next', etc.) lets you replace
;;     individual search hits without navigating through each search
;;     context in turn: direct access.
;;
;;   * In Icicles search, replace-all (`M-|') means replace all
;;     matches of your current input, throughout the search space, not
;;     just all matches that follow the cursor.  And remember that you
;;     can (a) activate the region to limit the search-and-replace
;;     space and (b) use progressive completion etc. to narrow the set
;;     of hits.
;;
;;   * You can act across multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks -
;;     see information about the `icicle-search' prefix arg.
;;
;;   * You can also replace matches within character-property search
;;     contexts - just use `icicle-search-char-property' (`C-c "') ["]
;;     as the search command.
;;
;;  Search matches are replaced - but just what is meant by a "search
;;  match"?  It can be either an entire search context or each match
;;  of your current minibuffer input within a search context.
;;
;;  Anytime during search and replace:
;;
;;   * `M-,' redefines the replacement string.
;;
;;   * `C-`' toggles `icicle-toggle-regexp-quote' (as always).  This
;;     escapes regexp special characters, so that search is literal.
;;
;;   * `M-q' toggles `icicle-search-whole-word-flag'.  By default,
;;     this is nil, meaning that searching is not for whole words
;;     (except for `icicle-search-word', bound to `C-c $').
;;
;;   * `C-M-`' toggles `icicle-search-replace-literally-flag'.  By
;;      default, this is nil, which means that `\' character sequences
;;      in replacement text are intrepreted as for
;;      `query-replace-regexp'.
;;
;;   * `C-,' toggles `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag'.  By
;;     default, this is non-nil, which means that the entire current
;;     search context is replaced, that is, whatever matches the
;;     context regexp that you entered initially using `RET'.
;;     However, you can use `C-,' anytime during searching to toggle
;;     between this default behavior and replacement of whatever your
;;     current minibuffer input matches.
;;
;;   * `M-;' toggles `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag'.
;;     Together with other options, it controls whether to replace the
;;     expanded common match or just the exact match.  See below.
;;
;;  REMEMBER THIS:
;;
;;  - If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is true
;;    (non-nil), then the granularity of replacement is a complete
;;    search context.  In this case, replacement behaves similarly to
;;    `query-replace-regexp' (except that special replacement
;;    constructs, such as `\#', are not treated as such).  You can
;;    still use minibuffer input to filter the set of search contexts,
;;    but replacement is on a whole-context basis.
;;
;;  - If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is false (nil),
;;    then you can replace multiple input matches separately within a
;;    search context (using `C-S-RET').  This behavior is unique to
;;    Icicles.  You cannot, however skip over one input match and
;;    replace the next one in the same context - `C-S-RET' always
;;    replaces the first available match in the context (repeated use
;;    changes which is first).  When
;;    `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is nil, you can
;;    also use special replacement constructs, such as `\#'.
;;
;;  If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is true, then you
;;  can use the navigational alternative action keys, `C-S-next',
;;  `C-S-prior', `C-S-down', and `C-S-up', repeatedly to replace
;;  successive search contexts.  At the buffer limits, these commands
;;  wrap around to the other buffer limit (last search context to
;;  first, and vice versa).
;;
;;  Search traversal using these go-to-next-context-and-replace keys
;;  is always by search context, not by individual input match.  This
;;  means that you cannot use these keys to replace input matches
;;  within a search context.
;;
;;  If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is false, then you
;;  can use these keys to replace the first input match.  More
;;  importantly, you can use `C-S-RET' to replace that first match,
;;  without moving on to the next context.  Because `C-S-RET' always
;;  acts on the current search hit (context), using it again, after
;;  you have used it to replace the first such match, replaces the
;;  next one.  And so on.
;;
;;  Thus, if your input matches multiple parts of a search context and
;;  you want to replace these matches, use `C-S-RET' repeatedly.
;;  After all of the matches in the current context have been
;;  replaced, `C-S-RET' replaces the first match in the next context.
;;  (There is a gotcha, however, if the replacement text matches your
;;  input - see below.)
;;
;;  You can thus traverse all matches of your input, in the current
;;  sort order (by default, the order they appear in the source being
;;  searched), by just repeating `C-S-RET'.  At the buffer limits,
;;  repeating `C-S-RET' wraps around.
;;
;;  `C-S-RET' always replaces the first input match in the
;;  current search context or, if there are no matches, then the first
;;  input match in the next context.  This behavior has these
;;  important consequences:
;;
;;  * If you repeat `C-S-RET' and the previous replacement no longer
;;    matches your input, then `C-S-RET' moves on to the next input
;;    match (which is now the first one) and replaces that.  This is
;;    why you can usually just repeat `C-S-RET' to successively
;;    replaces matches of your input, including from one context to
;;    the next.
;;
;;  * If, on the other hand, after replacement the text still matches
;;    your input, then repeating `C-S-RET' will just replace that
;;    match.  For example, if you replace the input match `ab' by
;;    `abcd', then repeating `C-S-RET' produces `abcd', then `abcdcd',
;;    then `abcdcdcd',...
;;
;;  * You cannot replace an input match, skip the next match, and then
;;    replace the following one, all in the same context.  You can,
;;    however, replace some matches and then skip (e.g. `C-next') to
;;    the next context.
;;
;;  What your input matches, hence what gets replaced if
;;  `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is nil, depends on a
;;  few Icicles options:
;;
;;  - `icicle-regexp-quote-flag' determines whether to use regexp
;;    matching or literal matching.
;;
;;  - `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag',
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag' and
;;    `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' together determine
;;    whether to replace exactly what your input matches in the
;;    current search hit or the expanded common match (ECM) of your
;;    input among all search hits.  If any of these options is nil,
;;    then your exact input match is replaced; otherwise, the ECM is
;;    replaced.
;;
;;  The replacement string can be nearly anything that is allowed as a
;;  replacement by `query-replace-regexp'.  In Emacs 22 or later, this
;;  includes Emacs-Lisp sexp evaluation via `\,' and constructs such
;;  as `\#' and `\N' (back references).  You can also use `\?', but it
;;  is not very useful - you might as well use `M-,' instead, to
;;  change the replacement text.
;;
;;  Finally, let me repeat what I said at the beginning of this page:
;;  Icicles search-and-replace is different from what you are used to,
;;  and there are several different ways to use it.  Experiment to get
;;  to know how it works, and reread the description here.
;;
;;  It is important to understand the various user options (with their
;;  toggle commands) and their effects.  They can radically change the
;;  behavior of replacement.
;;
;;  In particular, to put Icicles search-and-replace to best advantage
;;  you need to know what gets replaced, depending on those user
;;  options: the whole search hit vs only input matches, an exact
;;  input match vs the expanded common match.  Experiment with the
;;  toggles `M-_', `C-^', `C-;', and `M-;'.  And you need to know how
;;  repeated `C-S-RET' works vs repeated `C-S-next'.
;;
;;  I know it's tricky to learn.  Experimenting helps.  If something
;;  happens that you didn't expect, reread this section and try to
;;  understand.  Have fun.

;;
;;  Other Icicles Search Commands
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Function `icicle-search' is very general.  As is explained in
;;  (@> "Icicles Search Commands, Overview"), command `icicle-occur'
;;  is defined trivially using `icicle-search' - it is basically
;;  `icicle-search' with a regexp of `.*', to match lines.  Similarly,
;;  `icicle-search-word' (`C-c $') uses a regexp of `\bWORD\b', where
;;  `WORD' is the word to look for, and `icicle-search-keywords'
;;  (`C-c ^') uses a regexp of `\(KW1\|KW2\|KW2...\|KWn\)', where the
;;  `KWm' are the keywords (regexps) to look for.
;;
;;  Still other Icicles commands are available that make use of
;;  `icicle-search'.  And you can define your own, specialized search
;;  commands along the same lines.  To do that, it is instructive to
;;  look at the source code of the commands described in this section;
;;  they can serve as a model for defining your own search commands.
;;
;;  Two of the commands described here, `icicle-compilation-search'
;;  and `icicle-comint-search', are specialized versions of
;;  `icicle-search' that work only in particular buffers where there
;;  is little need for `icicle-search' itself. For this reason, these
;;  commands reuse the key sequence, `C-c `' (backquote), that is
;;  normally bound to `icicle-search'.  This shadow binding occurs if
;;  the current major mode is a compilation mode (for
;;  `icicle-compilation-search') or an interactive interpreter mode
;;  such as `shell-mode' or Lisp interactive mode (for
;;  `icicle-comint-search').
;;
;;  [Programmer Note: Actually, the way this works is that `C-c `' is
;;  bound to the value of internal variable `icicle-search-generic'.
;;  You can use this mechanism to provide custom Icicles search
;;  commands for particular buffers.]
;;
;;  Besides the commands described in this section, there are Icicles
;;  search commands for navigating tags-file definitions and searching
;;  their associated source files.  These are described in section
;;  (@> "Icicles Tags Enhancements").
;;
;;  If you use `M-g' in the minibuffer to toggle option
;;  `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', then you can use just `next'
;;  instead of `C-next' to navigate when using any Icicles search
;;  command.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;(@* "Searching Text with Properties")
;;  ** Searching Text with Properties **
;;
;;  Instead of providing a context regexp, for commands
;;  `icicle-search-char-property' (`C-c "') ["],
;;  `icicle-search-overlay-property', and
;;  `icicle-search-text-property' you provide a character property
;;  (e.g. `face') and its value (e.g. `font-lock-function-name-face').
;;  All zones of text that have that property with that value become
;;  the completion candidates (search hits).  As always, you can
;;  filter this set of candidates by typing input in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  By a "character property" is meant either a text property or an
;;  overlay property.  `C-c "' ["] searches both kinds of character
;;  property; `icicle-search-overlay-property' searches only overlay
;;  properties; and `icicle-search-text-property' searches only text
;;  properties.  For example, if you use `C-c "' ["] with a `face'
;;  property value `highlight', then the text searched includes text
;;  with that overlay value and text with that text-property value.
;;  With a `face' property value of `font-lock-string-face', you can
;;  browse or search doc strings, and so on.
;;
;;  If the property chosen is `face', then you can in fact choose
;;  multiple faces, in multi-command fashion (e.g. `C-mouse-2'), and
;;  the text that is searched has at least one of the faces you
;;  choose.  If you choose no face value (empty input), then the
;;  target is text that has any face at all.  The search hits are
;;  zones of text that are distinguished by their `face' values.
;;
;;  As with other Icicles search commands, a prefix argument controls
;;  whether these character-property commands search the current
;;  buffer, selected bookmarks, selected files, or selected buffers.
;;  However, keep in mind that, since in this case you are searching
;;  character properties, you will find search hits only for buffers
;;  that already have such properties, for example, buffers that have
;;  been fontified.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Imenu")
;;  ** Icicles Imenu **
;;
;;  Command `icicle-imenu', which is bound to `C-c =', is an Imenu
;;  browser.  It lets you use Icicles completion to navigate among
;;  definitions of functions, variables, types, keys, and so on in a
;;  programming language (in fact, any language that Imenu handles).
;;  As always in Icicles, your current input (e.g. a regexp) filters
;;  the set of available candidates.  That is, you can match against
;;  parts of an Imenu entry - any parts.  That's particularly useful
;;  if there are many entries in the Imenu menu; you don't need to
;;  read/scan the whole list.
;;
;;  If you look at the definition of `icicle-imenu' you'll see that it
;;  simply lets you choose an Imenu submenu (Functions, User Options,
;;  and so on) that is appropriate for the current buffer type, and
;;  then it calls `icicle-search', passing it the appropriate Imenu
;;  regexp.  You can similarly define your own specialized search
;;  commands using `icicle-search' to browse regexp matches.  You get
;;  all of the features of `icicle-search' when you do that.  For
;;  example, `icicle-imenu' gives you these advantages over a standard
;;  Imenu menu:
;;
;;  * You can restrict navigation (search) to a region.
;;
;;  * You can navigate (browse) among multiple entries, instead of
;;    choosing them one by one from a menu.
;;
;;  * You can restrict the entries to browse using (regexp) pattern
;;    matching.
;;
;;  * As for `icicle-search', you can search multiple bookmarks,
;;    multiple buffers, or multiple files.
;;
;;  In addition, for Emacs-Lisp function definitions, Icicles provides
;;  two specializations of `icicle-imenu', to find only Emacs command
;;  definitions and only non-interactive function (that is,
;;  non-command) definitions: `icicle-imenu-command' and
;;  `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function'.  The definitions of these
;;  two search commands provide examples of using `icicle-search' with
;;  a predicate argument.
;;
;;(@* "`icicle-imenu' Combines Benefits of Imenu and Emacs Tags")
;;  *** `icicle-imenu' Combines Benefits of Imenu and Emacs Tags ***
;;
;;  * Imenu lets you navigate among definitions in a single buffer.
;;
;;  * Emacs tags let you navigate among definitions in multiple files,
;;    but you must build and update the tags file that identifies the
;;    definitions.
;;
;;  Like Emacs tags, `icicle-imenu' lets you navigate among
;;  definitions in multiple files - and also multiple bookmarks and
;;  multiple non-file buffers.  Like Imenu, you need not build a tags
;;  file.  Unlike Imenu, Icicles provides regexp completion that lets
;;  you filter Imenu hits that you want to visit.
;;
;;  Another difference from Emacs tags, besides the need for a tags
;;  file, is that, since Icicles locates definitions using Imenu
;;  regexps, you can only navigate among definitions in buffers that
;;  you are visiting.  This is both an advantage and a disadvantage:
;;  you can narrow the search to certain files, but you must know
;;  which files to search. And if you want to search all files, then
;;  you must open them all (e.g. by matching a project regexp),
;;
;;  The differences mean that `icicle-imenu' does not provide a
;;  substitute for Emacs tags; it provides some similar
;;  functionality. It is another tool in your belt, handier in some
;;  situations than using tags, and less useful in some other
;;  situations.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Icicles Tags Enhancements")
;;
;;(@* "Compile/Grep Search")
;;  ** Compile/Grep Search **
;;
;;  In a compilation-results buffer, such as `*Compilation* or
;;  `*grep*', you can use command `icicle-compilation-search', bound
;;  to `C-c `', to search among the result set (search hits).  This is
;;  similar to `icicle-search', but when you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2',
;;  `C-prior', `C-next', `C-up', or `C-down', it visits the source
;;  code that corresponds to the current line in the compilation
;;  buffer.  Just as for `icicle-search', you can narrow the set of
;;  search contexts by typing a regexp.
;;
;;  Using `icicle-compilation-search' with `grep' gives you two levels
;;  of regexp searching: 1) the `grep' regexp and 2) your current
;;  input regexp.  And you can of course use progressive completion
;;  (`M-*') to add any number of additional levels.  (And, starting
;;  with Emacs 22, you can pipe to other `grep' commands in the same
;;  `M-x grep'.)
;;
;;  In Emacs 22 and later, you can also replace search-hit text.  You
;;  can replace the entire grep regexp match or just the part of it
;;  that matches your current input, depending on the value of option
;;  `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' (which you can toggle
;;  with `C-,').  Replacement acts here just as it does for
;;  `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  You can also use a non-`grep' compilation buffer to perform search
;;  and replace.  Use it, for example, to correct errors in source
;;  files.
;;
;;  Icicles thus gives you several ways to perform search-and-replace
;;  throughout multiple files: `grep'/compilation, `icicle-occur', and
;;  `icicle-search'.  The latter is of course not limited to
;;  line-by-line search.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Search and Replace").
;;
;;(@* "Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes")
;;  ** Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes **
;;
;;  In an interactive interpreter mode such as `shell-mode' or
;;  interactive Lisp mode, you can search for and reuse a previous
;;  input, possibly editing it first.  Command `icicle-comint-search',
;;  bound to `C-c `', lets you use Icicles completion and cycling to
;;  access your previous (shell or Lisp) inputs; it uses
;;  `icicle-search', so it highlights your regexp input matches, and
;;  so on.  You can use `C-$' at any time to toggle removal of
;;  duplicate past inputs as completion candidates; by default,
;;  duplicates are removed.
;;
;;  Being a search command, however, `icicle-comint-search' has access
;;  only to the commands that are visible in the buffer.  It does not
;;  use the `comint-input-ring', so it cannot, for instance, give you
;;  access to commands used in a previous session, which might have
;;  been recorded in a history file.
;;
;;  Another Icicles command, `icicle-comint-command', which is not a
;;  search command, does use `comint-input-ring' and does give you
;;  completion and cycling against previous inputs that might not have
;;  come from the current session.  It is bound to `C-c TAB' in
;;  `comint-mode' and derived modes.
;;
;;(@* "Define Your Own Icicles Search Commands")
;;  ** Define Your Own Icicles Search Commands **
;;
;;  Function `icicle-search' is not only a useful user command; it is
;;  also a framework for you to define your own Icicles search
;;  commands.  Consult the source code for the commands presented
;;  above for models.  And consult the doc string of `icicle-search'
;;  for more information about calling it non-interactively.  In
;;  particular, note that:
;;
;;  * You can pass a functional argument instead of a regexp to
;;    `icicle-search', and it will use that function to define the
;;    search contexts.  The function is passed, as arguments, the
;;    buffer to search, the beginning and end of the search region in
;;    that buffer, and any additional arguments that you pass to
;;    `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  * You can pass a predicate argument to `icicle-search', in
;;    addition to passing a regexp, and the search contexts will be
;;    only those regexp matches that also satisfy the predicate.  The
;;    predicate takes two arguments, the search-context string and a
;;    marker at the end of the search context.  For information about
;;    this, consult the doc string for function
;;    `icicle-search-regexp-scan'.  For a model of using this feature,
;;    see the code that defines command `icicle-imenu'.
;;
;;  By using your own function to define the search contexts, either
;;  from scratch or by limiting regexp matches using a predicate, you
;;  can perform semantic-based searching.  That is, your search
;;  command can use information besides syntax to define search hits.
;;  For instance, commands `icicle-imenu-command' and
;;  `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function' use the semantic predicate
;;  `commandp' to distinguish Emacs-Lisp commands from non-interactive
;;  functions.

;;
;;  Icicles Bookmark Enhancements
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Many of the enhancements described in this section are available
;;  only if you also use library `bookmark+.el' (which I recommend).
;;  Bookmark+ is compatible with vanilla Emacs bookmarks across
;;  multiple Emacs versions.  It enhances the use of bookmarks in many
;;  ways.  The explanation here does not attempt to describe the
;;  Bookmark+ enhancements; it describes only the Icicles features
;;  that make use of them.
;;
;;  One of the main Bookmark+ enhancements is support for new bookmark
;;  types.  Icicles provides type-specific bookmark commands and
;;  bookmark-candidate filtering.
;;
;;  Regardless of the bookmark type, another Bookmark+ feature that
;;  Icicles takes advantage of is the fact that a bookmark (any
;;  bookmark) can save not only a single position but a region, that
;;  is, two positions.  You can think of this as bookmarking, or
;;  saving, regions.  When you jump to a region bookmark, the region
;;  is activated (if option `bmkp-use-region' is non-nil).
;;
;;  These are the main Icicles bookmarking features:
;;
;;  * Bookmarking the region and selecting a bookmarked region
;;  * Setting a bookmark and jumping to a bookmark
;;  * Searching the text of a bookmark's buffer or region
;;
;;  Each is described in more detail below.
;;
;;  In addition, when you complete the names of some kinds of objects,
;;  you can use `C-x m' to choose objects of that type.  For example,
;;  when you use `icicle-dired' (`C-x d') to complete a directory
;;  name, you can use `C-x m' to choose among your Dired bookmarks.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Accessing Saved Locations (Bookmarks) on the Fly").
;;
;;(@* "Saving Regions and Selecting Them")
;;  ** Saving Regions and Selecting Them **
;;
;;  Saving the region just means bookmarking it.  As for any bookmark,
;;  it must have a name.  When you later jump to a region bookmark,
;;  the region is activated (provided option `bmkp-use-region' is
;;  non-nil).
;;
;;  Icicles gives you quick ways to save a region and select
;;  (activate) a saved region.  You can do both using `C-x C-x'.
;;
;;  * With no prefix arg, `C-x C-x' exchanges point and mark
;;    (activating the region), as usual.
;;
;;  * With a plain prefix arg (`C-u'), `C-x C-x' jumps to a region
;;    bookmark that you choose using completion, and activates it.
;;
;;  * With a numeric prefix arg, `C-x C-x' saves the region.  If the
;;    prefix arg is negative, then you are prompted for the name to
;;    use.  Otherwise, the bookmark is named automatically using the
;;    buffer name plus ": " plus the first
;;    `icicle-bookmark-name-length-max' characters of the region text.
;;    (Newline characters are changed to spaces for the name.)
;;
;;    So if (a) you are visiting buffer `foo', (b) the region text
;;    starts with "Arise, you wretched of the earth! For justice
;;    thunders condemnation: A better world's in birth!", and (c) the
;;    value of option `icicle-bookmark-name-length-max' is 15, then
;;    `C-9 C-x C-x' sets the region bookmark named `foo: Arise, you'.
;;
;;(@* "Setting a Bookmark and Jumping to a Bookmark")
;;  ** Setting a Bookmark and Jumping to a Bookmark **
;;
;;  Just as `C-x C-x' lets you either set or jump to a region
;;  bookmark, so `C-x r m' lets you either set or jump to any
;;  bookmark.  `C-x r m' is the vanilla Emacs key for setting a
;;  bookmark.  In Icicle mode it is bound by default to command
;;  `icicle-bookmark-cmd'. (By default, whatever keys are normally
;;  bound to `bookmark-set' are remapped in Icicle mode to
;;  `icicle-bookmark-cmd'.)
;;
;;  * With no prefix arg or a plain prefix arg (`C-u'), `C-x r m' acts
;;    like `icicle-bookmark-set'.  This is similar to `bookmark-set',
;;    but if you use Bookmark+ then you can use (lax) completion,
;;    choosing from existing bookmarks for the same buffer.  This
;;    makes it easy to update a nearby bookmark.
;;
;;    The same completion enhancements are available as for bookmark
;;    jumping - see (@> "Jumping to a Bookmark"), below.
;;
;;  * With a negative prefix arg, `C-x r m' jumps to a bookmark (with
;;    completion).  See (@> "Jumping to a Bookmark"), below.
;;
;;  * With a non-negative prefix arg, `C-x r m' sets a bookmark,
;;    automatically naming it.  This is like the automatic naming for
;;    a region bookmark, except that instead of including a prefix of
;;    the region text, the name includes text from the current line
;;    that starts at point.
;;
;;    So if the cursor in buffer `foo' is on the `y' in a line with
;;    the text "Arise, you wretched of the earth!", then the bookmark
;;    will automatically be named `foo: you wretch'.
;;
;;    If the prefix argument is 0, then the new bookmark does not
;;    overwrite any existing bookmark with the same name.
;;
;;(@* "Jumping to a Bookmark")
;;  ** Jumping to a Bookmark **
;;
;;  Icicles commands that jump to a bookmark are multi-commands: you
;;  can use them to jump to any number of bookmarks in a single
;;  invocation.  Each jump command acts as a bookmark browser.
;;
;;  As with most Icicles tripping commands, after you jump to a
;;  (non-region) bookmark, the cursor position is highlighted using
;;  cross hairs, if you also use library `crosshairs.el'.
;;
;;  Bookmark names are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*' to
;;  indicate the bookmark type.  The faces used are those defined by
;;  Bookmark+.
;;
;;  If option `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' is non-nil, then
;;  each completion candidate is a multi-completion, with up to three
;;  parts: the bookmark name, the bookmark file or buffer name, and
;;  any (del.icio.us-style) tags the bookmark has.  You can toggle
;;  option `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' (for the next command)
;;  using `M-m' during completion.
;;
;;  When using multi-completion candidates, you can match any of the
;;  multi-completion parts.  For example, you can match all bookmarks
;;  that have any tags by typing this when choosing a bookmark:
;;
;;    C-M-j . * C-M-j S-TAB
;;
;;  Or match all bookmarks whose names match `P42' and whose tags
;;  match `blue':
;;
;;    P 4 2 . * C-M-j . * C-M-j . * b l u e S-TAB
;;
;;  (Each `C-M-j' inserts `^G\n', which is `icicle-list-join-string'.)
;;
;;  `C-M-RET' shows detailed info about the current bookmark
;;  completion candidate.  `C-u C-M-RET' shows the complete, internal
;;  info for the bookmark.  Likewise, for the other candidate help
;;  keys: `C-M-down' etc.  And the mode line always shows summary
;;  info about the current bookmark.
;;
;;  During bookmark completion you can sort the candidates in various
;;  bookmark-specific ways:
;;
;;  * By the current (latest) `*Bookmark List*' order
;;  * By bookmark name
;;  * By last access as a bookmark (date + time)
;;  * By bookmark visit frequency (number of times visited)
;;  * By last buffer or file access (date + time)
;;  * With marked bookmarks before unmarked (in `*Bookmark List*')
;;  * By file name
;;  * By (local) file type
;;  * By (local) file size
;;  * By last (local) file access (date + time)
;;  * By last (local) file update (date + time)
;;  * By Info location (manual and node)
;;  * By Gnus thread
;;  * By URL
;;  * By bookmark type
;;
;;  The most general Icicles jump commands are `icicle-bookmark' and
;;  `icicle-bookmark-other-window'.  In Icicle mode these are bound to
;;  whatever `bookmark-jump' and `bookmark-jump-other-window' are
;;  normally bound to.  If you use Bookmark+, the default bindings are
;;  `C-x j j' and `C-x 4 j j', respectively.
;;
;;  When you use these commands, you can narrow the completion
;;  candidates to bookmarks of a specific type using these keys:
;;
;;  `C-M-b' - non-file (buffer) bookmarks
;;  `C-M-B' - bookmark-list bookmarks
;;  `C-M-d' - Dired bookmarks
;;  `C-M-f' - file bookmarks
;;  `C-M-F' - local-file bookmarks
;;  `C-M-g' - Gnus bookmarks
;;  `C-M-i' - Info bookmarks
;;  `C-M-K' - desktop bookmarks
;;  `C-M-m' - `man' pages
;;  `C-M-r' - bookmarks with regions
;;  `C-M-u' - URL bookmarks
;;  `C-M-w' - W3M (URL) bookmarks
;;  `C-M-@' - remote-file bookmarks
;;
;;  In addition, there are individual jump commands for bookmarks of
;;  each of each type, and these commands are bound by default to keys
;;  with the prefix `C-x 4 j' that use the same mnemonic characters as
;;  for narrowing.  For example, `icicle-bookmark-info-other-window'
;;  is bound to `C-x 4 j i'.
;;
;;  Commands `icicle-bookmark' and `icicle-bookmark-other-window' can
;;  use a cache for the set of available bookmarks.  This improves
;;  performance, especially if you have a lot of bookmarks.  The
;;  downside is that the list of completion candidates is not
;;  automatically updated when you add new bookmarks.
;;
;;  By default, this caching is off, so the set of possible bookmark
;;  candidates is always up-to-date.  You can turn on this caching by
;;  setting option `icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag' to nil.
;;
;;  Alternatively, you can use a prefix argument to reverse the effect
;;  of this option.  If you have a lot of bookmarks then I recommend
;;  that you customize the option to nil and just update it
;;  occasionally by using `C-u' for bookmark completion.  That will
;;  temporarily turn off caching so that the current jump command
;;  refreshes (updates) the cache.  The default value of the option is
;;  t only to avoid confusion for new users.
;;
;;  The bookmarks cache is also used for searching bookmarks (see
;;  next).  The type-specific bookmark jump commands
;;  (e.g. `icicle-bookmark-info-other-window') do not use the cache,
;;  since they typically use a smaller number of candidates.  And the
;;  cache is automatically updated whenever you use `S-delete' to
;;  delete a candidate bookmark.

;;(@* "Searching Bookmarked Objects")
;;  ** Searching Bookmarked Objects **
;;
;;  Icicles search (and replace) lets you search across multiple
;;  buffers, files, or bookmarks.  This is true for nearly all Icicles
;;  search commands.  You use a plain prefix argument to specify
;;  bookmark searching.  For command `icicle-search' itself (`C-u C-c
;;  `'), you can alternatively use the specific command
;;  `icicle-search-bookmarks-together'.
;;
;;  When you do this you first choose the bookmarks to search, using
;;  completion.  Use `C-RET' and similar multi-command actions to
;;  choose (use `RET' for the final choice).  Once you have chosen the
;;  bookmarks, you type a search pattern to narrow the set of
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  (Multi-command `icicle-bookmark-list' similarly lets you choose
;;  bookmark names.  It returns them as a Lisp list of strings.)
;;
;;  When you search the text of a region bookmark, the search is
;;  limited to the region.
;;
;;  In addition to using `C-u' with the general Icicles search
;;  commands, you can use the following Icicles search commands that
;;  are specific to bookmarks:
;;
;;  * icicle-search-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-bookmark-list-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-dired-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-file-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-gnus-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-info-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-local-file-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-man-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-non-file-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-region-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-remote-file-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-url-bookmark
;;
;;  All of these except `icicle-search-bookmark' act only on bookmarks
;;  of a specific type.  But all of them act the same way.  They are
;;  multi-commands, so you can use them to search multiple bookmarks.
;;  But unlike `icicle-search-bookmarks-together' (`C-u C-c `'), you
;;  do not first choose all of the bookmarks and then search them
;;  together.  Instead, you search them one at a time.

;;
;;  Icicles Tags Enhancements
;;  -------------------------
;;
;;  In Emacs and Icicles, the word "tag" is used in multiple ways.
;;  This section is about tags as identifiers of source-code
;;  definitions.  Emacs uses tags files, typically named `TAGS', to
;;  index these definition locations.
;;
;;  What constitutes a "definition" is determined by the content of
;;  the tags file.  Typically, definition recognition is available for
;;  programming languages, but in fact a tags table can record any
;;  text at all as a definition.  That is, if you create your own tags
;;  table, you can use the Emacs tags feature to navigate among any
;;  "definitions" of your own choosing.
;;
;;  If you use `M-g' in the minibuffer to toggle option
;;  `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', then you can use just `next'
;;  instead of `C-next' to navigate when using any of the Icicles tags
;;  browsing commands described here.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;  See Also:
;;
;;  * (@> "Support for Projects")
;;  * (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere")
;;
;;(@* "`icicle-find-tag': Find Tags in All Tags Tables")
;;  ** `icicle-find-tag': Find Tags in All Tags Tables **
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, you use commands such as `find-tag' (`M-.') to
;;  find a tag, `tags-loop-continue' (`M-,') to find another matching
;;  tag, `tags-apropos' to list all tags that match a regexp, and
;;  `list-tags' to show all tags (definitions) in a given source file.
;;
;;  In Icicles, you can use multi-command `icicle-find-tag', bound to
;;  `M-.' in Icicle mode, to do all of this.  It is similar to the
;;  Icicles search commands.  It is a general tags browser, just as
;;  `icicle-imenu' is an Imenu browser.  Being a multicommand, you can
;;  visit any number of tags, in any order, in a single `M-.'
;;  invocation.
;;
;;  With `icicle-find-tag', you enter (using `RET') a regexp to match
;;  the tags you want to visit.  By default, all tags in all tags
;;  files are searched, and the matches become completion candidates
;;  (which you can of course match further by typing another pattern).
;;  As always, you can use progressive completion, chip away the
;;  non-elephant, and so on.  Just as with Icicles search commands,
;;  you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', and so on, to visit the
;;  search hits.  You can use `M-*' (`icicle-pop-mark') to return to
;;  the place you invoked `M-.'.
;;
;;  By default, the completion candidates are multi-completions: the
;;  source file name is included.  This is an important aid, because
;;  there can be similar, or even identical, tags in different source
;;  files.  Your current input can of course filter the source-file
;;  name also, excluding certain files from the search.
;;
;;  A prefix argument  changes the default behavior, as follows:
;;
;;  * If non-negative (>= 0), then only the current tag table is used,
;;    instead of all tag tables.
;;
;;  * If non-positive (<= 0), then the source file name is not part of
;;    the completion candidate; only the tag itself is used.
;;
;;  See Also:
;;
;;  * (@> "Icicles Search Commands, Overview") for general information
;;    about Icicles search commmands.

;;(@* "`icicle-find-first-tag': Find First Tag in Current Table")
;;  ** `icicle-find-first-tag': Find First Tag in Current Table **
;;
;;  Sometimes you don't need the full power and flexibility of
;;  `icicle-find-tag'.  If you just want to find the first tag among
;;  several duplicates that match your input, and you just want to use
;;  the current tags table, then you can use `icicle-find-first-tag'
;;  or `icicle-find-first-tag-other-window'.  These commands are like
;;  vanilla `find-tag', but they are multi-commands, so you can visit
;;  any number of tags in one invocation.  Unlike `find-tag', however,
;;  you cannot follow up to find another tag that matches using `M-,'.
;;
;;(@* "`icicle-tags-search': Search and Replace Using Tags")
;;  ** `icicle-tags-search': Search and Replace Using Tags **
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, you use commands `tags-search',
;;  `tags-query-replace', and `tags-loop-continue' (`M-,') to search
;;  and replace text in source files whose definitions are indexed in
;;  a tags file.
;;
;;  In Icicles, you can use multi-command `icicle-tags-search' to
;;  search and replace.  It is in fact just command `icicle-search'
;;  applied to the relevant source files.

;;(@* "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements")
;;
;;  Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles provides completion support for shell commands in these
;;  ways:
;;
;;  * In Shell mode and related modes, it enhances completion of
;;    commands, previous inputs (commands plus their switches and
;;    arguments), file names, and environment variables.
;;    See (@> "Completion in Comint Modes").
;;
;;  * In any buffer, it provides Icicles completion for `M-!' and
;;    `M-|'.
;;
;;  * In Dired mode, it provides Icicles completion for `!', and `&'.
;;    See (@> "Shell Commands on Marked Files").
;;
;;  This section describes the completion available for `M-!' and
;;  `M-|'.  It applies also to completion for `!', and `&' in Dired
;;  (but those have additional enhancements).
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, when you enter a shell command at the prompt for
;;  `M-!' or `M-|', no completion is available for Emacs prior to
;;  Emacs 23.  In Emacs 23, no completion is available for empty
;;  input, and non-empty input is completed only to a shell command in
;;  your search path.
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, `M-!' and `M-|' can, like in vanilla Emacs 23,
;;  complete using commands on your search path.  This depends on the
;;  the value of option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' (see below).
;;
;;  The most significant thing about Icicles completion for reading a
;;  shell command is that it is enhanced *file-name* completion.  This
;;  means that you can easily invoke a program no matter where it
;;  resides, whether or not its directory is in your search path.  You
;;  can use completion to navigate to the command's location.
;;
;;  Icicles shell-command completion is lax, so you can enter any
;;  command you want, not just a completion candidate, and you can
;;  edit completed input, to add switches (options) and arguments.
;;
;;  Though file-name completion is used for reading shell commands,
;;  extra, known commands are also made available as completion
;;  candidates if option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-nil
;;  (it is nil by default).  These extra candidates are the names of
;;  all executable files (or of all files, if
;;  `shell-completion-execonly' is nil) in your search path.
;;
;;  The fact that these are Icicles *extra* candidates means that they
;;  are available regardless of the current default-directory - they
;;  are not in fact treated as file-name candidates, even though they
;;  are available during file-name completion.  You can easily
;;  recognize Icicles extra candidates in buffer `*Completions*': they
;;  have face `icicle-extra-candidates'.  See (@> "Global Filters").
;;
;;  If `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-nil, the list of
;;  search-path candidate commands is computed once and cached as the
;;  value of option `icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache'.  The
;;  particular non-nil value of `icicle-guess-commands-in-path'
;;  determines when the cache is filled.
;;
;;  If the value of `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is `first-use',
;;  the cache is filled the first time you use it, and each time you
;;  turn on Icicle mode it is updated.  If the value of
;;  `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is `load', then the cache is
;;  instead filled each time you load Icicles.
;;
;;  Regardless of the non-nil value of
;;  `icicle-guess-commands-in-path', if you save
;;  `icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache', then that value is used
;;  in future sessions (no delay for searching your path).
;;
;;  If your environment changes, you can use command
;;  `icicle-recompute-shell-command-candidates' to update the cached
;;  list at any time.  With a prefix argument, the updated value is
;;  saved persistently.
;;
;;  In addition to the extra candidates computed by searching your
;;  search path, in contexts such as Dired where target (e.g. marked)
;;  files for the shell command are known, the extra candidates
;;  include additional commands (possibly including switches) that
;;  Icicles can guess might be appropriate for the target files.
;;  See (@> "Shell Commands on Marked Files").
;;
;;  During shell-command completion, help is available for individual
;;  candidates, using `C-M-RET', `C-M-mouse-2', and so on.  For an
;;  extra candidate, help is provided for the command by the `apropos'
;;  shell command (if available).  For a file-name candidate, help
;;  shows the file's properties.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Get Help on Candidates").
;;
;;  Remember also:
;;
;;  * After you have typed or completed the shell command per se
;;    (e.g. a file name or search-path command), you can use `C-M-S-f'
;;    (file-name completion on demand) to complete (relative) file
;;    names to insert as shell-command arguments as part of the
;;    command line to submit to the shell.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc2.el" :to "Completion On Demand").
;;
;;  * You can use `M-o' anytime in the minibuffer to complete against
;;    a previous input.  This means that if you have previously
;;    entered some complex shell command (e.g. with various switches
;;    or arguments), then you can use `M-o' to retrieve it for reuse
;;    (possibly editing it).  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc2.el" :to "Using Completion to Insert Previous Inputs: `M-o'")
;;
;;  * If for some reason you do not want to use the enhancements
;;    described here, just customize option
;;    `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' to nil.  If you do
;;    that, then Icicle mode will not substitute any Icicles commands
;;    for standard commands.
 
;;(@* "Icicles Dired Enhancements")
;;
;;  Icicles Dired Enhancements
;;  --------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles can help with Dired in these ways:
;;
;;  * You can use completion when you use `!' or `&' to execute a
;;    shell command.
;;
;;  * You can use Icicles search-and-replace on the marked files.
;;
;;  * You can save marked file names as completion candidates for
;;    reuse later.
;;
;;  * You can open Dired on saved file names, that is, names that you
;;    previously saved as a completion candidates set or as an Emacs
;;    fileset.  It does not matter how the file names were saved or
;;    which directories the files are in.
;;
;;(@* "Shell Commands on Marked Files")
;;  ** Shell Commands on Marked Files **
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, `!' and `&' in Dired let you complete a shell
;;  command.  All Icicles completion features are available.  This is
;;  the same program-file completion that is available anywhere when a
;;  shell command is read (see
;;  (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements")), but in Dired the extra
;;  candidates include commands that Icicles thinks might be
;;  particularly appropriate for the marked files.
;;
;;  These extra candidates are not necessarily only command names.
;;  They can include switches (options) that specialize a command.
;;  For example, if a PDF file (*.pdf) is marked in Dired, the
;;  completion candidates might include `gv -safer', `pdftotext ?  -',
;;  and `xpdf'.  The first two of these are not just command names
;;  (`-safer' is a command switch).
;;
;;  Starting with Emacs 23, Icicles uses both of the following methods
;;  to guess extra candidates that are file type-specific:
;;
;;  * MIME-type associations
;;
;;  * The rules defined by user option `dired-guess-shell-alist-user'
;;    and variable `dired-guess-shell-alist-default' (provided you use
;;    Dired X, that is, standard library `dired-x.el')
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 23, MIME types are not used.  In the example of a
;;  PDF file, candidates `gv -safer' and `pdftotext ? -' are provided
;;  by MIME-type associations, and candidate `xpdf' is provided by the
;;  Dired X rules.  Note that you can customize the rules.
;;
;;  Any candidates that are specific to the marked files are Icicles
;;  *extra* candidates -- see (@> "Global Filters").  These are
;;  available regardless of the current default-directory.  They are
;;  not treated as file-name candidates, even though they are
;;  available during file-name completion.  Icicles extra candidates
;;  have face `icicle-extra-candidates' in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  Again, everything that is true for shell-command completion
;;  elsewhere is also true for shell-command completion in Dired.  See
;;  (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements").  This includes adding
;;  all commands from your search path as extra candidates if option
;;  `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-nil, and providing help on
;;  individual candidates (shell commands or files) during completion.
;;
;;(@* "Search-and-Replace Marked Files")
;;  ** Search-and-Replace Marked Files **
;;
;;  In Dired, `A' searches the marked files using a regexp, and `Q'
;;  launches `query-replace-regexp' on them.  But suppose that you
;;  want to change only a few occurrences in each file, perhaps among
;;  the first occurrences.  Using `Q', you are forced to review each
;;  search hit in turn - all of them; you cannot simply skip the rest
;;  in one file and continue with the next file.
;;
;;  [I suggested that this feature be added to Emacs, and it has been
;;  added in Emacs 23: you can now skip to the next file.]
;;
;;  One workaround is to use `M->' to go to the end of a file, and
;;  then `M-,' to resume query-replace.  Or you can quit the command
;;  altogether, unmark the file you're finished searching, and then
;;  hit `Q' again, but that's not very convenient.  A similar problem
;;  applies to searching using `A'.
;;
;;  In Dired with Icicles, you can use `M-s i'
;;  (`icicle-search-dired-marked') to search the files and possibly
;;  replace search hits.  This runs `icicle-search', so you have
;;  available all of its features, including accessing search hits
;;  directly, in any order.  To skip a whole file, just match its name
;;  with your minibuffer input and then use `C-~' to remove all of its
;;  occurrences from the set of hits.
;;
;;  Note: You can similarly use `M-s i' in Ibuffer or Buffer Menu to
;;  search all marked buffers using Icicles search.
;;
;;(@* "Save Marked Files as Completion Candidates")
;;  ** Save Marked Files as Completion Candidates **
;;
;;  In Dired with Icicles, you can use `C-M->'
;;  (`icicle-dired-save-marked') to save the marked file names as a
;;  set of completion candidates, for reuse later.  You can use `C->'
;;  to add the marked files to an existing saved set of candidates.
;;  These bindings act similarly to `C-M->' and `C->' in the
;;  minibuffer: a prefix argument controls whether you save candidates
;;  to a variable or a cache file.
;;
;;  You can use such a saved set of file names as candidates during
;;  file-name completion.  They are saved as absolute names,
;;  which means you can use them with, say, `C-u C-x C-f'.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Absolute File Names and Different Directories").
;;
;;(@* "Open Dired for a Set of File Names")
;;  ** Open Dired for a Set of File Names **
;;
;;  In Dired with Icicles you can use `C-M-<'
;;  (`icicle-dired-chosen-files-other-window') to open Dired for a set
;;  of file or directory names that you choose interactively or that
;;  you have previously saved (persistently or not) as completion
;;  candidates or as an Emacs fileset.  The Dired buffer that is
;;  created is named `Icy File Set' (suffixed with <1>, <2>, etc. as
;;  needed), and it contains only the chosen file names.
;;
;;  The file names are checked to be sure they reference existing
;;  files.  If any of the names are relative names, those files are
;;  checked for existence in the Dired directory.  If you use a prefix
;;  argument, then you are prompted for the directory to use.
;;
;;(@* "Marked Files as a Project")
;;  ** Marked Files as a Project **
;;
;;  Just as `C-}' in the minibuffer is a shortcut for `C-u C-M->',
;;  which saves the current set of completion candidates persistently,
;;  so `C-}' in Dired saves the marked file names in a cache file or,
;;  with a prefix arg, an Emacs fileset.  Similarly, just as `C-{' in
;;  the minibuffer is a shortcut for `C-u C-M-<', which retrieves
;;  candidates from a persistent set, so `C-{' in Dired retrieves a
;;  persistent set of file names and opens them in a separate Dired
;;  buffer.
;;
;;  You can think of such persistent file-name sets as projects.
;;  `C-}' is bound to command `icicle-dired-save-marked-as-project'
;;  (aka `icicle-dired-save-marked-persistently').  `C-{' is bound to
;;  command `icicle-dired-project-other-window'.
;;
;;  Again, you can use such a project as a candidate set for file-name
;;  completion at any time.  In addition, `C-}' and `C-{' can be handy
;;  in Dired for working with projects even without using completion.
;;  The files in a project can be distributed among any directories
;;  anywhere.  This gives you an easy way to open Dired on just the
;;  files you want and operate on them there.
;;
;;  And while in a project in Dired you can use `C-M-<' to mark a
;;  project subset to work on, and then use `C-M->' to operate on that
;;  subset using Icicles completion.  And you can have any number of
;;  projects - you access each by its name (with completion) and need
;;  not remember its cache file name.

;;
;;  Icicles Info Enhancements
;;  -------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles can help with Info in these ways:
;;
;;  * Icicles completion is available for any input.
;;
;;  * You can use `icicle-search' on part or all of a manual, if you
;;    flatten it first with `Info-merge-subnodes' .
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Completion for Info")
;;  ** Icicles Completion for Info **
;;
;;  Whenever completion is available for Info commands, such as `g'
;;  (`Info-goto-node'), `i' (`Info-index'), and `m' (`Info-menu'), you
;;  can take advantage of Icicles completion.  For instance, if you
;;  type `g yan', you can use `S-TAB' for apropos completion and
;;  choose node `Isearch Yank', whose name contains `yan' but does not
;;  start with it.  This is an obvious and standard Icicles feature.
;;
;;  Although vanilla Emacs also accepts a substring as input for `i',
;;  it does not provide substring or regexp completion, and it won't
;;  accept a regexp as final input.
;;
;;  Icicles binds `g', `i', and `m' to multi-commands
;;  `icicle-Info-goto-node', `icicle-Info-index', and
;;  `icicle-Info-menu', which means that you can also use `g', `i',
;;  and `m' with `C-next', `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', and so on, to browse
;;  among matching Info nodes.  Unlike browsing with repeated use of
;;  `,' after `i' in vanilla Emacs, you can continue to see all of the
;;  matching candidates, in buffer `*Completions*', and you need not
;;  visit the index hits in sequential order.
;;
;;  If you use `M-g' in the minibuffer to toggle
;;  `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', then you can use just `next'
;;  instead of `C-next' to navigate.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;  As usual in Icicles, you can sort completion candidates in various
;;  ways, using `C-,' (`icicle-change-sort-order').  For `g', in
;;  particular, although the default order is alphabetical, you can
;;  choose `in book order', which shows the node candidates in the
;;  same order as in the book.  In that case, using `g' and then
;;  navigating among candidates sequentially using `C-up', `C-down',
;;  `C-next', or `C-prior' visits the nodes in their natural order.
;;
;;  As a special case of this, if you use a negative prefix argument
;;  (that is, `M-- g'), then not only are the candidate nodes
;;  presented `in book order', they are also limited to the nodes that
;;  follow your current location in the book - that is, to the
;;  remainder of the book.  (A non-negative numeric prefix argument
;;  has the same meaning as for `Info-goto-node'.)
;;
;;  In addition, except when you are at the `Top' node, a pseudo-node
;;  `..' is added to the set of completion candidates.  Choosing this
;;  takes you up to the parent of the current node.  You can thus use
;;  `g' in Info not only to explore nodes by name, but also as another
;;  means to traverse the Info menu hierarchy.
;;
;;(@* "Virtual Info Books")
;;  *** Virtual Info Books ***
;;
;;  You can take advantage of Icicles completion-candidate set
;;  operations to create your own virtual Info books.  That is, you
;;  can define and save sets of Info nodes or Info index entries, and
;;  then reuse them later.
;;
;;  Both `m' and `g' in Info use nodes as candidates, so you can use
;;  `m' or `g' or a combination of `m' and `g' to define a node set,
;;  and you can use either `m' or `g' to reuse a node set.  A set of
;;  index entries is different: You must use `i' to create and reuse
;;  such a set.
;;
;;  Remember that you can define a candidate set incrementally, adding
;;  more elements using `C->', `C-)', `insert', `M-S-mouse-2',
;;  `M-mouse-3', or `mouse-1 mouse-3 mouse-3'.  And you can save a
;;  candidate set persistently.
;;
;;  You can even create a virtual book that includes Info nodes from
;;  different manuals.  For example, you might want to collect
;;  together specific nodes that deal with some particular topic, such
;;  as faces, from both the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual.
;;
;;  You do this using `C-u g' (a plain prefix argument).  This
;;  prepends the Info file name (book identifier) to each node-name
;;  completion candidate.  For example, when you are in the Emacs
;;  manual, each node candidate is prefixed by `(emacs)', and in the
;;  Elisp manual each candidate is prefixed by `(elisp)'.  You define
;;  a set of candidates in the usual Icicles ways, changing manuals as
;;  needed to add additional nodes to the set you save.
;;
;;  A node name prefixed by its file name is analogous to an absolute
;;  file name, that is, a relative file name prefixed by its
;;  directory.  Because such a saved candidate has a book prefix,
;;  e.g. `(emacs)', it is absolute and unambiguous.  You can use it
;;  wherever you happen to be in Info, to go directly to that node.
;;  This is a feature of `g' even in vanilla Emacs: you can go to a
;;  node in a different manual from the one you are currently
;;  visiting.
;;
;;  When you want to reuse a virtual book, hit `g' again, retrieve the
;;  saved set of node candidates that defines the book, and navigate
;;  among the saved nodes.
;;
;;  If you use library `info+.el', you can also take advantage of its
;;  definition of virtual books and saved Info nodes.  That library
;;  defines command `Info-virtual-book', which opens Info on a Table
;;  of Contents of a virtual book of nodes that you have saved either
;;  using command `Info-save-current-node' or by customizing user
;;  option `Info-saved-nodes'.
;;
;;  Icicles command `icicle-Info-virtual-book' extends
;;  `Info-virtual-book' by letting you define the virtual book nodes
;;  using completion.  That is, you can use `g' to save a set of
;;  node-name completion candidates (as the value of variable
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-candidates'), and then use command
;;  `icicle-Info-virtual-book' to open an Info buffer with those nodes
;;  as a menu.
;;
;;  If you have not saved any node-name candidates, then
;;  `icicle-Info-virtual-book' acts the same as `Info-virtual-book':
;;  it opens the virtual book that is defined by `Info-saved-nodes'.
;;  With `info+.el', the key `.' adds the current node to
;;  `Info-saved-nodes', which gives you a convenient way to build up a
;;  virtual book as you read.  This is like Emacs bookmarking, but it
;;  keeps your saved Info nodes separate from your other bookmarks.
;;
;;  With a prefix argument, `icicle-Info-virtual-book' lets you choose
;;  a persistently saved completion set to use instead of
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-candidates' or `Info-saved-nodes'.  This
;;  means that you can have any number of such saved node sets as
;;  virtual books, to use at any time.
;;
;;  See Also:
;;
;;  * (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates")

;;
;;(@* "Using Icicle-Search With Info")
;;  ** Using Icicle-Search With Info **
;;
;;  Icicles searching (`icicle-search') is not Isearch.  It searches
;;  for all matches in the portion of text you tell it to search.
;;  This means that you cannot use it to search an entire manual in
;;  one operation, unless you have the entire manual available in a
;;  single buffer to be searched.
;;
;;  So, when you use `icicle-search' (`C-c `') to search with Info,
;;  you are limited to a few options:
;;
;;  * You can use it normally, to search within a single Info node.
;;
;;  * You can widen the visible portion of the Info buffer
;;    (`C-x n w'), to use it on an entire Info file.  However:
;;
;;    1. It is not obvious how a given Info manual is divided into
;;       files.  That is, you need to be aware of the point at which
;;       the manual moves from one file to the next.
;;
;;    2. Only the nodes in the same file that you have already visited
;;       are highlighted, and lots of ugly Info "plumbing" becomes
;;       visible in the other nodes.
;;
;;    3. You lose all Info features, such as navigation using links.
;;
;;  * There is another way to search across nodes, which addresses #1
;;    and #2, but still does not give you navigable links and such.
;;    Think of it as a hack that can sometimes be handy.  That is what
;;    is described below.
;;
;;  The idea is to flatten a subtree of Info nodes - possibly an
;;  entire manual, but more typically a node and its children - and
;;  then use `icicle-search' (`C-c `') over that flattened document.
;;  What is needed is a command that flattens Info subtrees.  Library
;;  `info+.el' provides such a command, `Info-merge-subnodes', and
;;  binds it to `+' in Info.
;;
;;  You can control how you want the flattening to occur, by using
;;  different values of prefix argument.  For searching, you probably
;;  want complete flattening of the chosen subtree, in a single
;;  buffer, so you use a prefix arg of zero: `C-u 0 +'.
;;
;;  This does not replace the *Info* buffer that you started with; it
;;  creates a new buffer, named after the root node of the subtree you
;;  flattened.  A principle use of `Info-merge-subnodes' is to print
;;  out a manual or a portion of it.  Also, I wrote a library
;;  (`mkhtml.el', outdated now) that lets you convert the result to
;;  HTML.
;;
;;  In sum, you can use Icicles search in Info: `C-u 0 +', then
;;  `C-c `'.
;;
;;  One caveat, however: You will generally want to limit your search
;;  to a reasonably small subtree of a manual, instead of flattening
;;  and then searching the entire manual.  Flattening a large manual
;;  can take a while: it took me 10 minutes to flatten the Emacs
;;  Manual.  Of course, you could flatten a large manual once, and
;;  save the result in a file for later searches.
;;
;;  Obviously, flattening in order to search is less convenient than
;;  using manual-wide incremental search (`C-s') with Info (starting
;;  with Emacs 22), and it is often less convenient than using
;;  `Info-search' (bound to `s' in Info).  Icicles searching is
;;  different from both, and it has its advantages and disadvantages.
;;  When you want the advantages of Icicles searching in Info, the
;;  flattening hack can be useful.  When you don't need those
;;  advantages, other search methods can sometimes be more
;;  appropriate.

;;
;;  Icicles Support for Projects
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  This section mainly provides pointers to other sections of the
;;  Icicles doc that describe features that can help you work with a
;;  project that involves multiple files, buffers, or bookmarks.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmarks for Project Access and Organization")
;;  ** Bookmarks for Project Access and Organization **
;;
;;  If you use Bookmark+ (library `bookmark+.el'), then you can use
;;  bookmarks of various types, including the following, to help
;;  manage software projects:
;;
;;  * Dired buffers, with specific sets of files and subdirectories
;;    that are marked or omitted, and using specific listing switches.
;;
;;  * `*Bookmark List*' buffers, with specific sets of bookmarks that
;;    are marked or hidden.
;;
;;  * Multiple alternative bookmark files.  For example, use a
;;    different one for each project.  Or use different ones for
;;    subprojects and use them together for a full project.
;;
;;  * Desktops, which include sets of variables and visited buffers
;;    and files.
;;
;;  * Composite, or sequence, bookmarks, which combine other
;;    bookmarks.
;;
;;  You can also associate tags, in the del.icio.us sense, with most
;;  types of bookmarks.  (Such tags are unrelated to the Emacs
;;  source-code tags that use tags files.)  A bookmark can have any
;;  number of tags, and multiple bookmarks can have the same tag,
;;  which means you can use them to organize their target objects.
;;  And tags can be more than just names: they can be user-defined
;;  attributes, with Emacs-Lisp objects as their values.
;;
;;  These and other Bookmark+ features give you different ways to
;;  save, restore, filter, access, and otherwise organize projects, as
;;  collections of information about source-code components and
;;  related software.
;;
;;  Icicles enhances access to such features.
;;  See (@> "Icicles Bookmark Enhancements").
;;
;;(@* "A Tags File Can Define a Project")
;;  ** A Tags File Can Define a Project **
;;
;;  One simple kind of a project includes the files that are in or
;;  under a single directory.  Such a project is limited, but it can
;;  often be useful, and it has the advantage of being supported by
;;  several existing Emacs features.
;;
;;  Another simple kind of project includes the files that are listed
;;  in a given Emacs tags file.  This is obviously more complex and
;;  flexible than a directory listing.
;;
;;  Icicles provides multi-commands for visiting one or more files
;;  that are listed in the current tags table:
;;  `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table' and
;;  `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table-other-window'.  See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icicles Commands that Read File Names").
;;
;;(@* "Navigating Among Code Definitions")
;;  ** Navigating Among Code Definitions **
;;
;;  For software projects, you need to be able to navigate among code
;;  definitions.  Imenu and Emacs tags features are useful for this,
;;  as are `grep' and compilation buffers.  Icicles improves all of
;;  these.  (A tags file is just a saved index for project files.)
;;
;;  See Also:
;;
;;  * (@> "Icicles Imenu")
;;  * (@> "Icicles Tags Enhancements")
;;  * (@> "Compile/Grep Search")
;;
;;(@* "Searching Project Files")
;;  ** Searching Project Files **
;;
;;  Searching within your project is another area where Icicles can
;;  help.  Icicles search is both search and navigation.  Navigating
;;  among tags definitions that match a regexp is also really
;;  searching, and the same is true for Imenu and grep navigation.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Icicles Search Commands, Overview") and its
;;  subsections for information about the many ways that you can use
;;  Icicles search to access parts of your projects.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Icicles Dired Enhancements") for an easy way to
;;  search marked files in Dired with Icicles search.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Searching Bookmarked Objects") for ways to search
;;  bookmarked objects, including the files that have a given set of
;;  del.icio.us-style tags and the bookmarks that are marked in a
;;  given bookmark-list state.
;;
;;  And don't forget that all uses of Icicles search also let you do
;;  search-and-replace on the fly.  This applies to `grep' results,
;;  searching marked files in Dired, tags navigation, and Imenu
;;  navigation.  You can at any time replace the current search hit
;;  or just the part of it that matches your current input.
;;
;;(@* "Defining and Saving Sets of Files or Buffers")
;;  ** Defining and Saving Sets of Files or Buffers **
;;
;;  Let's assume that you have one or more sets of files or buffers
;;  that you use frequently.  For each such set of objects, you create
;;  an Emacs option whose value is a list of the file or buffer names
;;  (strings).
;;
;;  Later, you use the option value to refer to those objects by name.
;;  This brings you back to the context of working with just those
;;  particular files or buffers that belong to your project.  You can
;;  search such sets or navigate among their objects.  Icicles has a
;;  number of features that can help with these tasks.
;;
;;  Note: Bookmarks are also persistent references to files and
;;  buffers, and you can use sets of bookmarks similarly.  Bookmarking
;;  is a vanilla Emacs feature.  Being able to manipulate explicit
;;  sets of bookmarks is a Bookmark+ feature (library `bookmark+.el').
;;  Bookmarking features are described elsewhere, but they work in
;;  concert with Icicles to offer very good project support.
;;  See (@> "Icicles Bookmark Enhancements").
;;
;;  Before you can name and save a set of file or buffer names, you
;;  must define its members: pick the file and buffer names that you
;;  want to belong to a given project.  Icicles can help with this.
;;
;;  For buffers, use commands `icicle-add-buffer-config' and
;;  `icicle-remove-buffer-config' to define one or more buffer
;;  configurations.  These are named sets of buffers, sort functions,
;;  and other parameters that control completion of buffer names.
;;  Thereafter, you can use command `icicle-buffer-config' to choose a
;;  configuration to be current.
;;
;;  To define a set of files, you use Icicles completion against file
;;  names.  You can use progressive completion, chip away the
;;  non-elephant, and so on, to get just the file names you want.
;;
;;  For this completion, you can use a command that calls
;;  `read-file-name', and so matches relative file names using the
;;  current `default-directory'.  Or you can use a command that calls
;;  `completing-read', and so matches file names only as ordinary
;;  strings, that is, with no notion that they are file names.  In the
;;  latter case, the file names are often absolute, which means that
;;  you can match not only file names but also directory components.
;;
;;  Examples of the former type are `icicle-find-file' and
;;  `icicle-find-file-read-only' (`C-x C-r' by default).  Examples of
;;  the latter type are `icicle-find-file-absolute',
;;  `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table', `icicle-recent-file', and
;;  `icicle-locate-file'.  Command `icicle-file' (bound to `C-x C-f'
;;  by default) lets you do both, depending on the prefix argument.
;;
;;  You save a set of file names the same way you save any set of
;;  completion candidates.  You can save all of the names that match
;;  your current input.  You can add a set of names or individual
;;  names to a set of names that you have already saved.
;;
;;  In addition, you can save the marked files in Dired as a set of
;;  project files.
;;
;;  Your project is not only files that are all in the same directory,
;;  of course.  You can save file names from multiple directories in
;;  the same set.  And you can include directory names as well, for
;;  use later with commands that operate on directories.  Finally, you
;;  can also save file names as Emacs filesets and use those the same
;;  way.  An Icicles set of saved file names can include Emacs
;;  filesets - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Filesets and Icicles Saved Completion Sets").

;;
;;(@* "Retrieving and Reusing a Saved Project")
;;  ** Retrieving and Reusing a Saved Project **
;;
;;  This section could also be called "Using Retrieved Saved Sets".
;;
;;  You retrieve a set of saved file names (a project) the same way
;;  you retrieve any saved set of completion candidates.  That is, you
;;  access the files defined for your project by retrieving their
;;  names during completion, to serve as the current set of completion
;;  candidates.  This odd feature is unique to Icicles.
;;
;;  There's nothing much more to say about this, except that you
;;  should be taking advantage of it now.  Define and save a set of
;;  project files (or buffers), and later use just those files,
;;  staying within the bounds of your project for your navigation,
;;  search, compilation, etc. needs.  Even if the files you use in a
;;  given project are scattered all over your file system, Icicles
;;  lets you access them together as a named unit.  For more
;;  information, see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  If you use library `bookmark+.el' then you can open a project that
;;  is defined by a set of bookmarks, by doing one of the following:
;;
;;  * Using a project-specific bookmark file.
;;
;;  * Using a bookmark-list bookmark (it records a `*Bookmark List*'
;;    buffer state, including which bookmarks are marked or omitted).
;;
;;  You can also open Dired for a project or for a list of file names
;;  saved non-persistently as completion candidates - only those files
;;  are listed in the Dired buffer.
;;  See (@> "Icicles Dired Enhancements").
;;
;;  You can also run `grep' on a saved list of file names using
;;  command `icicle-grep-saved-file-candidates'.  If you use library
;;  `dired+.el', then you can also `grep' the files in a project or
;;  saved list of file names by opening it in Dired and then using
;;  `M-g' (`diredp-do-grep').
;;
;;  Finally, note that among the sets of completion candidates that
;;  you can save are Icicles search hits.  That's right.  Icicles
;;  search lets you search multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks, and
;;  you can save selected search hits or all matching hits for later
;;  use.  When you save search hits, Icicles records the buffer or
;;  file names and the hit locations within those buffers or files.
;;  When you retrieve such a saved set to access its hits, Icicles
;;  automatically takes you to the proper files.
;;
;;  A related feature is being able to filter tags definitions and
;;  then save the filtered hit list.  This works the same way, and it
;;  gives you the equivalent of per-project tags files: A saved hit
;;  list acts just like a custom tags file when you reuse it.  And
;;  unlike some of your project files, a tags file doesn't change
;;  often, so saved hit sets stay accurate longer.

;;
;;  But you are a different story.  If you use, say, Semantic, you

;;(@* "Using Complex Completion Candidates")
;;
;;  Using Complex Completion Candidates
;;  -----------------------------------
;;
;;  This section could also be called "Applying a Function
;;  Interactively" or "Mapping over Sets".  It is about applying a
;;  function to members of a set of completion candidates that you
;;  select interactively.  The candidates can represent arbitrarily
;;  complex data, and the function is applied to the associated data
;;  as well, not just to the displayed (string) candidate that names
;;  the data.
;;
;;  You already know that you can manipulate sets of candidates - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;  The elements of those sets are strings; you choose
;;  candidate names.  Sometimes, however, you need to choose among
;;  named items that are themselves complex, containing more
;;  information than just the name.  That is the idea behind
;;  multi-command `icicle-apply', which this section introduces.
;;
;;  You (or a command that you use) can obtain the information
;;  associated with a name after you choose the name.  This is what
;;  happens, for instance, when you use `find-file'; the command looks
;;  up the file associated with the file name you choose.  Icicles
;;  multi-commands such as `icicle-file' perform this lookup both when
;;  you act on a candidate during completion (e.g. `C-RET') and when
;;  you make a final candidate selection (`RET') - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands").
;;
;;  Names and their associated information can be available in Emacs
;;  Lisp in the form of an association list (alist), that is, a list
;;  whose items are conses (cons cells).  An alist is often used to
;;  represent a function that maps one set of things to another.  The
;;  conses in the alist represent the tuples (typically pairs) of
;;  related items.  The car of each cons is called its "key"; the cdr
;;  is called its "value".  Different alists have different kinds of
;;  keys and values.  Typical key types include symbols and strings;
;;  typical value types include symbols, strings, numbers, and lists.
;;  There are quite a few standard Emacs-Lisp variables whose value is
;;  an alist.  Most are internal variables, but some are user options.
;;  See the Emacs-Lisp manual for more about alists.
;;
;;  The completion mechanism of Emacs function `completing-read' can
;;  take an alist as input: the keys are the completion-candidate
;;  strings that you choose from.  For Emacs completion, however, the
;;  value (cdr) of each alist key/value entry is completely ignored.
;;  Icicles uses `completing-read', and it works the same way.  If a
;;  command needs to access the value associated with a key
;;  (candidate), then it must somehow do so independently of
;;  completion.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' offers an example of this.  The completion
;;  alist contains key/value pairs whose car (key) is a search-hit
;;  string that matches your search string and whose cdr (value) is
;;  the buffer position for the hit.  When you use completion with
;;  this command, you work only with the keys, but `icicle-search'
;;  also keeps track of the corresponding buffer positions for you.
;;  The logic for doing this is coded into the definition of
;;  `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  It is common to want to do something interesting interactively
;;  with the values also, not just the keys, of a completion alist.
;;  Why lose the important value information when you choose a key?
;;  And instead of requiring the logic of each command to deal with
;;  this need individually, why not provide a general mechanism for
;;  accessing this information - both by program and interactively?
;;  This is what command `icicle-apply' is for.
;;
;;  To make use of completion alist values, you need to access the cdr
;;  of a key/value cons (pair).  Different alists are structured
;;  differently: the cdr can itself be complex (structured - a cons).
;;  In general, you want to access not just the cdr (value) but the
;;  key as well, the key/value pair as a whole, to do what you want
;;  with it - that is, to apply some function to it.
;;
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers sometimes map functions over lists to
;;  obtain a different list.  For example, mapping the function `1+'
;;  over the list (3 1 4 1 5 9) gives the list (4 2 5 2 6 10).  Or if
;;  interested only in the side effects, they apply a function
;;  iteratively over a list without bothering to accumulate the
;;  results as a new list.  The command `icicle-apply' is inspired by
;;  these common practices of mapping and iterating over a list, but
;;  it applies only to alists.  And it lets you choose interactively
;;  which alist elements to act on, instead of always acting on all
;;  elements.
;;
;;  `icicle-apply' lets you apply a function of your choice to any
;;  number of key/value entries in an alist.  As user of the command,
;;  you choose the entries to act on.  The alist is used for
;;  completion; you choose among the keys.  The function is applied to
;;  the corresponding key/value pairs, however, not to the keys alone.
;;
;;  For example, given the alist `auto-mode-alist' and the function
;;  `cdr', you can choose to apply `cdr' to selected alist entries.
;;  This acts as a simple lookup function, because `cdr' just returns
;;  the value associated with a chosen key.  If you choose, for
;;  example, the candidate (key) "\.el\'", then the (value) result is
;;  the symbol `emacs-lisp-mode'.  In this case, the chosen key/value
;;  pair is ("\\.el\\'" . emacs-lisp-mode).  (A literal backslash must
;;  be doubled in an Emacs-Lisp string.)
;;
;;  Function `cdr' returns the value, which is `emacs-lisp-mode' here.
;;  If instead of `cdr' you use the function (lambda (x)
;;  (describe-function (cdr x))), then the result of choosing
;;  candidate "\.el\'" is to display the help for function
;;  `emacs-lisp-mode'.  This function first uses `cdr' to obtain the
;;  value (the mode) and then applies `describe-function' to that
;;  value.
;;
;;  A typical use of `icicle-apply' is to define your own
;;  multi-command that you or someone else can use to act on objects
;;  selected by name.  The definition of command `icicle-goto-marker'
;;  provides an example.  It uses an alist whose elements are pairs
;;  composed of a text line (the key) and the marker (the value) in
;;  that line.  It applies a function that moves to the marker.
;;
;;  If called interactively (as opposed to being used to define
;;  another command), `icicle-apply' lets you use completion to choose
;;  not only the objects to act on but also the function to apply to
;;  them and the alist to choose them from.  See the doc string of
;;  `icicle-apply' for more information.
;;
;;  Note that you can type in a lambda expression when prompted for
;;  the function.  You can use any function, provided it targets a
;;  key/value pair (a cons).  This is why you could not simply use
;;  `describe-function' itself as the function to apply in the example
;;  above: `describe-function' expects a symbol argument, not a cons.
;;
;;  So what is `icicle-apply' really for?  Anything you want.  You can
;;  use it to simply browse an alist or to perform actions on complex
;;  things.  The idea is to let you take advantage of Icicles features
;;  to interactively filter and manipulate a set of completion keys,
;;  and then apply any function you like to them - not just to the
;;  keys, but to the keys or their values, or both.
;;
;;  You can use apropos (regexp) matching or prefix matching to filter
;;  the alist, as always, during completion.  You can use `C-RET' and
;;  so on to act on (that is, apply the function to) selected
;;  key/value pairs that match your current input.
;;
;;  You can also act on *all* such pairs, by using `C-!' or `M-!'.
;;  `C-!' corresponds to iterating over the items in a list, applying
;;  a function to each.  `M-!' applies a function not to each chosen
;;  pair, but to the *list* of all chosen pairs.  By default, the
;;  completion candidates are not sorted, but you can of course sort
;;  them in various ways, either interactively or by program.
;;
;;  As an Emacs-Lisp programmer, you can use function `icicle-apply'
;;  programmatically to let users look things up in alists that you
;;  construct or to act on selected alist entries in complex ways.
;;  Icicles just provides the interactive completion features.
;;
;;  The real value of `icicle-apply' comes from what you do with it.
;;  Use it with a database of geographical coordinates to look up
;;  location names provided by users and draw corresponding vicinity
;;  maps.  Use it with a list of hardware configurations to let users
;;  perform diagnostic or maintenance operations on selected
;;  equipment.  You get the idea - use your imagination.
;;
;;  Note: Although completion alists normally require string-valued
;;  keys, `icicle-apply' is designed to work with any alist.
 
;;(@* "Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction")
;;
;;  Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction
;;  --------------------------------------
;;
;;  Here's another crazy Icicles feature: Instead of choosing a
;;  function (e.g. command) and then the object to apply it to, choose
;;  the object first and then the function.
;;
;;  The first thing to say about this feature is that Emacs is not
;;  really designed for this, so it's not feasible to do this in a
;;  entirely satisfactory way.  In particular, there is no practical
;;  way, given an object, to find all of the functions that apply to
;;  it, in order to allow all of those functions, and only those
;;  functions, as completion candidates.
;;
;;  The second thing to say is that there are several ways that
;;  Icicles helps you operate on an object that you have already
;;  chosen:
;;
;;  * apropos completion - (1) choose an object type by name, (2)
;;    choose a function, (3) choose the target object
;;
;;  * alternative action by type, during completion - (1) choose a
;;    target object, (2) choose a function appropriate for the
;;    object's type.
;;
;;  * `M-RET' during completion - (1) choose a target object, (2)
;;    choose any function
;;
;;  * `icicle-object-action' and `icicle-anything' - (1) choose an
;;    object type by name, (2) choose the target object, (3) choose a
;;    function
;;
;;  As a special case, if you use library Anything (`anything.el'),
;;  then `icicle-object-action' lets you apply one or more Anything
;;  actions defined for the object.  See (@> "Icicles with Anything")
;;  for more information.
;;
;;(@* "Apropos Completion as OO")
;;  ** Apropos Completion as OO **
;;
;;  You can use apropos completion with `M-x' to narrow the set of
;;  possible commands to those that have a given object type in their
;;  name.  You choose the command before the individual object, but
;;  you at least choose the object type first (which narrows the set
;;  of possible objects).
;;
;;  If you use Icicles, you already use apropos completion this way,
;;  but you might not have thought about it in these terms.  If you
;;  want to invoke some command on a buffer, you might start by typing
;;  `M-x buffer S-TAB' or `M-x buff S-TAB'.  This is simple, but it
;;  really does get you most of the way toward object-action
;;  interaction.  And you can of course then use progressive
;;  completion (`M-*') to filter the matching commands for additional
;;  object-type names; for example `M-* window' keeps only those
;;  commands whose names contain both `buffer' and `window'.
;;
;;  Of course, this approach requires the command name to actually
;;  advertise truthfully the object types that it operates on.  There
;;  are false positives and true negatives, but Emacs is generally
;;  quite helpful in this respect.
;;
;;(@* "Alternative Action as OO")
;;  ** Alternative Action as OO **
;;
;;  As explained in
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Alternative Actions"),
;;  many Icicles commands, as their alternative action
;;  (e.g. `C-S-RET'), prompt you to choose an action to be applied to
;;  the current completion candidate.  The actions you can choose are
;;  all appropriate functions for the current type of object
;;  (candidate).  If you use library Anything (see below), then any
;;  actions defined for the current type by Anything are included.
;;
;;  See Also:
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Alternative Actions").
;;
;;(@* "M-RET")
;;  ** M-RET **
;;
;;  `M-RET' (`icicle-candidate-read-fn-invoke') during completion
;;  provides a typeless object-action interaction, which is always
;;  available.  (You can also use `ESC RET' or `ESC C-m'.)
;;
;;  This is similar to the action choice provided for some
;;  commands by `C-S-RET', except that there is no notion of the
;;  current object type - you can choose from among all Emacs-Lisp
;;  functions.
;;
;;  Whenever you cycle through completion candidates, `M-RET' enters a
;;  recursive edit that prompts you for a function to apply to the
;;  current candidate.  `M-mouse-2' does the same thing.  For example,
;;  if the current candidate is a buffer named `foo.el', then `M-RET'
;;  prompts you for a function to apply to it.  (Actually, the
;;  function is applied to the candidate, which is the buffer name in
;;  this case, but many functions accept an object name in place of
;;  the object.)
;;
;;  The function you enter can be anything, including a lambda
;;  expression that accepts an argument of the appropriate type.  The
;;  function is read with (lax) completion.  It is up to you to choose
;;  a function that is appropriate for the current object type.
;;
;;  If you use a prefix argument (`C-u M-RET' or `C-u M-mouse-2'),
;;  then the result of the function application is pretty-printed.
;;  Otherwise, the function is called for effect only.
;;
;;(@* "`icicle-object-action' and `icicle-anything'")
;;  ** `icicle-object-action' and `icicle-anything' **
;;
;;  Another way that Icicles helps with object-action interaction is
;;  provided by command `icicle-object-action'.  This reads an
;;  object-type name ("what"), with completion; then it reads an
;;  object of that type ("which"), with completion; then it reads a
;;  function (name or lambda expression) to apply to the object
;;  ("how"), with (lax) completion.  Again, use a prefix argument if
;;  you want to pretty-print the result.
;;
;;  `what-which-how' is an alias for command `icicle-object-action'.
;;  It is easy to remember, taking its name from the successive input
;;  prompts: "What?" - a file.  "Which?" - icicles.el.  "How?" open.
;;  Another alias for the same command is `a', because it acts on a
;;  file, a buffer, a symbol, a process, and so on.  The first thing
;;  it does is prompt you for the type of object, so you do `M-x a RET
;;  buffer', `M-x a RET symbol', and so on.
;;
;;  The aliases `what-which-how' and `a' are just convenience
;;  commands.  They are defined only if user option
;;  `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' is non-nil.  Two related
;;  commands are also defined only if this option is non-nil:
;;
;;  * `file'   - same as `a RET file'
;;  * `buffer' - same as `a RET buffer'
;;
;;  For example: `M-x file RET'.  You are prompted for a file to act
;;  on, and then for the action to use.
;;
;;  Note: If you use AUCTeX, then be aware of an AUCTeX bug that
;;  causes problems if `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' is non-nil.
;;  Here is the bug description, filed 2007/10/05 by Bjorn Haagensen:
;;  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-auctex/2007-10/msg00006.html.
;;  The problem is that AUCTeX mistakenly invokes the Icicles `file'
;;  command, in an inappropriate context.  AUCTeX does not define any
;;  function `file' when it is loaded, but it invokes one, if defined.
;;  This appears to be a name-capture problem.  Since there is no
;;  `file' function defined when Icicles is loaded, Icicles defines
;;  its command.  AUCTeX developers will no doubt fix this bug.  Until
;;  then, AUCTeX users can avoid the bug by setting
;;  `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' to nil.
;;
;;  The "type" of an object is one of these:
;;
;;  a. A type defining an entry in user option
;;     `icicle-predicate-types-alist'.  These are type predicates,
;;     such as `bufferp', `keywordp', or `atom'.
;;
;;  b. The `type' of an Anything source, or its `name' if it has no
;;     `type'.  This is available only if you use library
;;     `anything.el'.
;;
;;  c. A type defining an entry in user option
;;     `icicle-type-actions-alist'.
;;
;;  Icicles completion is available for each prompt: the type, the
;;  object, and the action to apply to the object.  Types defined by
;;  Anything are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.  In the case of an Anything type, you
;;  can use multi-command features to act on multiple objects in
;;  multiple ways, all within a single `a' invocation.  See
;;  (@> "Icicles with Anything") for more information about using
;;  Anything types.
;;
;;  The objects of types (b) and (c) are easily named, and their names
;;  serve as the completion candidates when you choose them.  So, for
;;  instance, if you choose type `buffer', then you can act on a
;;  buffer by choosing its name.
;;
;;  The objects of predicate type (type a, above) are not necessarily
;;  named.  The completion candidates for these objects are symbols
;;  whose values are the objects that are acted upon. The object-type
;;  names used for these candidates are really Emacs-Lisp type
;;  predicate names, which all end in `p', except for `atom'.
;;
;;  So, for instance, if you choose type `bufferp', then you can
;;  choose a symbol whose value is a buffer, in order to act on that
;;  buffer.  A buffer is of course always named, but an object of type
;;  `stringp' is not.  The value of `emacs-version' is one such string
;;  that you can act on.
;;
;;  Be aware that the action function you choose must accommodate the
;;  object you choose as its only argument.  Also, completion of the
;;  function candidate itself is lax, so you can enter a lambda
;;  expression as the action.
;;
;;  Objects that are naturally associated with names are treated
;;  differently, depending on the type.  Besides Anything types, the
;;  following object types are used for named objects: `buffer',
;;  `command', `face', `frame', `function', `option', `process',
;;  `symbol', `variable', `window'.  For all of these except `window',
;;  the name of the object is used.  For `window', the candidate
;;  objects are the names of the buffers that are currently shown in a
;;  window (on any frame).
;;
;;  You'll note that some types are treated both ways, 1) using named
;;  objects and 2) using symbols whose values are objects.  An example
;;  is `frame' and `framep': the completion candidates (objects) for
;;  type `frame' are frame names; the candidates for type `framep' are
;;  symbols whose values are frames.

;;
;;  Icicles with Anything
;;  ---------------------
;;
;;  Library Anything (`anything.el') lets you define object types and
;;  associate actions with them.  It provides command `anything',
;;  which you can use to apply an action to an object, choosing the
;;  object first by name.  All objects (of all types) that have a name
;;  that matches your input are candidates.  You can use command
;;  `anything' while in Icicle mode; it has the same behavior with
;;  Icicles as without it.
;;
;;  Icicles also integrates some Anything features within its own
;;  completion environment, so that you can use Icicles features such
;;  as progressive completion at the same time.  In particular, you
;;  can act on multiple Anything objects in the same command
;;  invocation, and you can act on them using multiple Anything
;;  actions.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-anything' (alias `any') is just command
;;  `icicle-object-action' (alias `a') restricted to Anything types -
;;  see (@> "Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction").  It is more
;;  convenient than `a' if you know that you want to use an Anything
;;  type, because the set of type candidates to choose from is more
;;  limited.
;;
;;  When you act on an object of an Anything type, you are not
;;  prompted for the action ("how").  The default Anything action is
;;  applied, or you can choose a different Anything action.
;;
;;  Command `any' (or command `a' when applied to an Anything type) is
;;  a multi-command (see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands")):
;;
;;  * `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', and so on perform the default Anything
;;    action on each chosen object.
;;
;;  * `C-S-RET', `C-S-mouse-2', and so on, prompt you, for each chosen
;;    object, to choose one or more Anything actions (with
;;    completion).
;;
;;  You can thus act on any number of Anything objects in any number
;;  of Anything ways, all in the same `any' command invocation.  And
;;  you can of course use Icicles completion and cycling to choose.
;;  User option `icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag' determines
;;  whether Anything function `anything-transform-candidates' is
;;  applied to displayed Anything candidates in Icicles.
;;
;;  Here's an example of using command `any'.  Let's assume that you
;;  have an `action' entry such as this in `anything-type-attributes'
;;  for the Anything type `command':
;;
;;  (action ("Call interactively"
;;           . (lambda (command-name)
;;               (call-interactively (intern command-name))))
;;          ("Describe command"
;;           . (lambda (command-name)
;;               (describe-function (intern command-name))))
;;          ("Add command to kill ring" . kill-new)
;;          ("Go to command's definition"
;;           . (lambda (command-name)
;;               (find-function (intern command-name)))))
;;
;;  This defines four actions for objects of type `command', the
;;  default action being the first listed ("Call interactively").
;;
;;  You enter command `any', choose the Anything type `command', and
;;  then choose the command `icicle-face-list' to act on:
;;
;;    M-x any RET
;;    What (type): command RET
;;    Which (command): icicle-face-list RET
;;
;;  This invokes command `icicle-face-list', because the default
;;  Anything action for an object of type `command' is to call it.
;;
;;  If you use `C-RET' instead of `RET' when choosing command
;;  `icicle-face-list', then you remain within the `any' invocation,
;;  and you can do something with another command after
;;  `icicle-face-list'.  If you use `C-S-RET' when choosing a command,
;;  then you are prompted for the action to invoke for that command:
;;
;;    Which (command): icicle-face-list C-S-RET
;;    How (action): Go to command's definition RET
;;
;;  If you choose the Anything action "Go to command's definition",
;;  then, well, that's what happens: here, you go to the definition of
;;  `icicle-face-list'.  Again, you could use `C-RET' instead of
;;  `RET', to perform this action on the command and then choose and
;;  apply (via `RET' or `C-RET') another action to the same command.
;;
;;  After you've stopped (via `RET' or `C-g') acting on command
;;  `icicle-face-list', you can clear the minibuffer (using `M-k') and
;;  type another command to act on, and so on.  Or, you can stop (via
;;  `RET' or `C-g') and end the invocation of command `any'.
;;
;;  At each prompt, you can use (apropos or prefix) completion or
;;  cycling to pick a candidate.  So, for instance, using completion,
;;  you could simply do this to choose `command', `icicle-face-list',

;;
;;  Icicles enhances Anything by providing multi-command features, as
;;  well as by providing all of the other standard Icicles features:
;;  apropos and prefix completion, cycling, progressive completion,
;;  help on individual candidates, and so on.  On the other hand,
;;  Anything by itself provides some features that Icicles does not
;;  exploit.  The aim of command `any' is to give you the basic
;;  Anything features in an Icicles completion context.
;;
;;  A significant behavior difference between Anything (that is,
;;  command `anything') and Icicles command `any' is that with
;;  `anything' only the object name is used for filtering, whereas
;;  with Icicles command `any' you first narrow down the potential
;;  candidates by type, before the object name is matched (against
;;  objects of only that type).
;;
;;  That is, with Anything, your input pattern is matched against
;;  every possible object of every possible type.  You then choose
;;  among the matches.  If you want, after that wide-net matching you
;;  can cycle among only the matches of a given type (e.g. file), but
;;  matching against all other types has already taken place.
;;
;;  This behavior of starting with typeless matching can be convenient
;;  sometimes (you need not specify the object type), but it can also
;;  be inconvenient (and unnecessarily slow) to match objects of types
;;  totally unrelated to what you're after.  In such cases, it can
;;  require either a long input pattern or cycling among more
;;  candidates, to disambiguate among the hits.
;;
;;  With Icicles command `any', you have the inconvenience of needing
;;  to specify first the type of object you want, but this has the
;;  advantage of eliminating searching among irrelevant types.
;;  Finally, remember that you can use both `anything' and `any' -
;;  choose whichever is most convenient for the current task.

;;
;;  Multi-Completions
;;  -----------------
;;
;;  This section is about using completion candidates that are
;;  composed of more than one part: strings that you can complete
;;  against separately and simultaneously.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Multi-Completion Commands")
;;  ** Icicles Multi-Completion Commands **
;;
;;  Have you ever used standard Emacs command `apropos-documentation'?
;;  It searches the doc strings of all Emacs-Lisp symbols for matches
;;  to an input regexp, and displays the hits.  It can be useful when
;;  you don't remember the name of a function or variable but you can
;;  guess at terms that might occur in its doc string.  Typically,
;;  people resort to it only after first trying apropos commands that
;;  match against the function or variable name.
;;
;;  The idea behind `apropos-documentation' also motivates Icicles
;;  command `icicle-doc'.  This is a multi-command (see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands")),
;;  so you can use `C-RET' and `C-next' to browse the regexp matches,
;;  displaying the documentation of each match in turn, and you can
;;  change the regexp to get different matches during the same command
;;  invocation.
;;
;;  Like `apropos-documentation', `icicle-doc' lets you match a regexp
;;  against the doc strings of symbols such as functions, variables,
;;  and faces.  You can of course use progressive completion to match
;;  multiple regexps.  Here, for example, is a query that shows all doc
;;  strings (functions, variables, faces - a lot! of doc strings)
;;  that match both `mail' and `mode line', in either order,
;;  as completion candidates:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-doc RET mail S-SPC mode line
;;
;;  You cannot do that with vanilla Emacs `apropos-documentation' or
;;  with any other vanilla Emacs `apropos*' command.
;;
;;  Commands `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-fundoc', and `icicle-plist' are
;;  similar to `icicle-doc' in the kind of functionality they provide.
;;
;;  Each of these commands gathers a tremendous amount of information
;;  to construct an initial set of completion candidates based on all
;;  existing Emacs symbols (in the standard `obarray').  This is
;;  time-consuming.  Since the set of symbols that have property lists
;;  or that name functions, variables, or faces changes little, you
;;  can optionally bypass this gathering and reuse the last initial
;;  set of candidates for that command.  You do this by invoking the
;;  command using a prefix argument (non-negative prefix arg, for
;;  `icicle-vardoc' and `icicle-plist').
;;
;;  Each of these particular commands also uses Icicles
;;  multi-completion.  A "multi-completion" is a completion candidate
;;  that has multiple parts.  A multi-completion command lets your
;;  input match any or all parts individually, at the same time.
;;
;;  * Commands `icicle-vardoc' and `icicle-fundoc' let you match both
;;    the function or variable name and the doc string.
;;
;;  * Command `icicle-doc' lets you match any combination of the
;;    following:
;;
;;    - the function, variable, or face name
;;    - the type: FUNCTION, VARIABLE, or FACE (uppercase)
;;    - the doc string
;;
;;  * Command `icicle-plist' lets you match both a symbol name and its
;;    property list.  You can use it to find symbols with certain
;;    property-list keys or values.  By default (for Emacs 22 or
;;    later), plists are pretty-printed (in `*Help*' and
;;    `*Completions*'), but if you use a negative prefix argument then
;;    pretty-printing is skipped, gaining a little time.
;;
;;  * Command `icicle-describe-option-of-type' (bound to `C-h C-o' in
;;    Icicle mode) lets you match both an option name and the option's
;;    `defcustom' type definition.  There are several ways to match
;;    type definitions, controlled by the prefix argument - see the
;;    command's doc string.  You can match a type directly or taking
;;    type inheritance into account.  You can match a type as a sexp
;;    or using a regexp.  You can match a type expression or match the
;;    option's current value against a type.
;;
;;  Other Icicles commands that use multi-completion include
;;  `icicle-locate-file', `icicle-locate-file-other-window',
;;  `icicle-recent-file', and `icicle-recent-file-other-window'.
;;  These commands let you match against two-part multi-completion
;;  candidates that are composed of an absolute file name and the
;;  file's last modification date.  This means that you can easily
;;  find those notes you took sometime last week...
;;
;;  The way multi-completion commands work is a bit inelegant perhaps,
;;  and it can take a little getting used to, but it is quite powerful
;;  and lets you do things with completion that are otherwise
;;  impossible.
;;
;;  In the case of commands that use two-part multi-completions, you
;;  provide two regexps as input, one to match the name of a symbol
;;  (e.g. a function or variable) and one to match some associated
;;  information (doc string, property list, or type definition).
;;
;;  However, since completion candidates are not actually multipart,
;;  you in fact type a single regexp that is the concatenation of the
;;  two.  You join these two regexps using `icicle-list-join-string'
;;  (a user option), which, by default, is `^G^J', that is, a
;;  control-G character followed by a control-J (newline) character.
;;  As always, you can input control characters using `C-q', so to
;;  input `^G^J' you can use `C-q C-g C-q C-j'.
;;
;;  However, in Icicles, `C-j' (newline) is self-inserting during
;;  completion, so you don't need to quote it with `C-q' - you can use
;;  just `C-q C-g C-j'.  Better yet, you can use `C-M-j'
;;  (`icicle-insert-list-join-string') to insert `^G^J'.
;;
;;  This has the added benefit (in Emacs 22 or later) of hiding the
;;  `^G' - it's there, but you don't see it.  This hiding is only
;;  cosmetic; you still match the characters `^G' and `^J'.  In the
;;  same way, Icicles hides the `^G' part of `^G^J' in *Completions*,
;;  so the join string appears as a newline character.
;;
;;  This hiding of `^G' happens only when option
;;  `icicle-list-join-string' has its (ugly but useful) default value.
;;  If not seeing the join string confuses you and you would prefer to
;;  distinguish multi-completion part separators from ordinary newline
;;  characters, then customize `icicle-list-join-string' - just remove
;;  the following from the Lisp sexp that defines the default value:
;;
;;    (set-text-properties 0 1 '(display "") strg)
;;
;;  As an example of using a multi-completion command, you can use the
;;  following to match a function name that contains `dired' and its
;;  doc string that contains `file':
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired^G^Jfile S-TAB
;;
;;  That is, you type this:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired C-q C-g C-j file S-TAB
;;
;;  or this:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired C-M-j file S-TAB
;;
;;  Well, almost.  The way it actually works is that the completion
;;  candidates are themselves formed by concatenating symbol names
;;  with their doc strings, using `icicle-list-join-string'.  Your
;;  input regexp is matched against those candidates.  This means that
;;  the input regexp `dired^G^Jfile' would actually match only
;;  function names that *end* with `dired' and doc strings that
;;  *begin* with `file'.
;;
;;  To match `file' against any part of the doc string, you must
;;  explicitly link the two component regexps with a regexp that
;;  matches anything.  If you want to search only the first lines of
;;  doc strings, you can use `.*' to do that: `dired.*^G^J.*file' will
;;  match all functions whose names contain `dired' and whose doc
;;  strings' first lines contain `file'.
;;
;;  Why only the first lines?  Because `.' matches any character
;;  except a newline - it doesn't look past the first line.  If you
;;  want to search the entire doc strings (or property lists, for
;;  `icicle-plist'), then you need to use a connecting regexp that
;;  matches any character, including a newline.  That means a regexp
;;  such as `\(.\|\n\)'.  Or you can just use the Icicles multi-line
;;  dot feature - see (@> "Dot, Dot, Dot").
;;
;;  Without a multi-line dot, you would use something like this to
;;  search whole, multi-line doc strings for `file':
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired.*^G^J\(.\|\n\)*file S-TAB
;;
;;  That is, you would type (without the spaces):
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired.* C-M-j \ ( . \ | C-j \ ) * file S-TAB
;;
;;  With a multi-line dot, you would type just this:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc dired.* C-M-j . * file S-TAB
;;
;;  What if you want to match, say, `file' in either the function name
;;  or the doc string, not necessarily both?  Remember that a
;;  multi-completion is in fact a single string, with a separator such
;;  as `^G^J' in the middle somewhere.  Because it is a single string,
;;  the simple minibuffer input `file' matches the substring `file'
;;  anywhere in the multi-completion.  So the answer is just this:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-fundoc file S-TAB
;;
;;  Even this simple command expression combines the effect of Emacs
;;  commands `apropos-function' with that of `apropos-documentation'.
;;
;;(@* "How Multi-Completions Work")
;;  ** How Multi-Completions Work **
;;
;;  These commands that accept a multipart regexp are examples of
;;  Icicles multi-completion.  Icicles extends standard function
;;  `completing-read' so that it will accept, as the set of completion
;;  candidates, an alist argument whose candidates are not only
;;  individual strings but can also be lists of strings.  Each string
;;  in the list is one part of a multipart completion candidate, that
;;  is, a multi-completion.  The strings are joined together pairwise
;;  using `icicle-list-join-string' by `completing-read'.  Commands
;;  `icicle-fundoc' and`icicle-vardoc' each use lists of two strings
;;  (name and doc), but a multi-completion can have any number of
;;  strings.
;;
;;  Why is the default value of `icicle-list-join-string' so odd:
;;  `^G^J'?  You can use any string you like, but here is the
;;  rationale behind the default choice:
;;
;;  - ^G does not normally occur in simple strings such as doc strings
;;  - a newline (^J) visually separates the multiple component strings
;;  - ^G^J is not too difficult to enter: `C-M-j' or `C-q C-g C-j'
;;
;;  It is important that the value of `icicle-list-join-string' not be
;;  something that is, itself, likely to match any of the candidates.
;;  Otherwise, it would not serve its role as separator.
;;
;;  I find that it helps a bit (in Emacs 22 or later) to customize
;;  face `escape-glyph', which is used for control characters such as
;;  `^G', in such a way that it stands out a bit, especially because
;;  control characters can be used in regexps that also use `^' as a
;;  special character.  I use an orange background with a blue
;;  foreground for this face.
;;
;;  Because multi-completions often extend over multiple lines, and
;;  candidates in buffer *Completion* appear one right after the
;;  other, it's helpful to add additional separation between
;;  multi-completion candidates.  That is the purpose of user option
;;  `icicle-list-end-string', whose default value is "^J^J" (two
;;  newline characters).  It is automatically appended to each
;;  candidate, for purposes of both display and matching.  Remember
;;  that it is part of each multi-completion candidate, especially if
;;  you use a regexp that ends in `$', matching the end of the
;;  candidate.
;;
;;(@* "Multi-Completions Let You Match Multiple Things in Parallel")
;;  ** Multi-Completions Let You Match Multiple Things in Parallel **
;;
;;  Consider the command `describe-option-of-type', defined in my
;;  library `help-fns+.el' (or `help+.el', for Emacs 20).  This lets
;;  you first pick a `defcustom' type using completion and then pick
;;  an option of that type to describe.  There are two separate,
;;  sequential acts of completion.  For each completion act, your
;;  current input defines a set of matches.  You can see all option
;;  types that match, say, the regexp `.*string', which means all
;;  types that contain `string'.  After you choose one of those types,
;;  you can see all options of that type whose names start with
;;  `icicle' and then pick one.
;;
;;  You can thus tweak the type regexp to filter types, and you can
;;  tweak the name regexp to filter option names.  And you can of
;;  course use progressive completion to whittle down either set of
;;  matches, piecemeal.
;;
;;  What you cannot do, however, using `describe-option-of-type' is
;;  filter both sets at the same time: narrow down the set of type
;;  matches and name matches simultaneously.  For that, you need
;;  Icicles multi-completion.  Without it, you must commit 100% to a
;;  type before you can choose among the options of that type.  With
;;  it, you can change the type (or the name) part of your input
;;  regexp on the fly, and see immediately the set of matching names
;;  (or types) as well.
;;
;;(@* "Multi-Completions vs `completing-read-multiple'")
;;  ** Multi-Completions vs `completing-read-multiple' **
;;
;;  Note that there is (only) a superficial similarity between Icicles
;;  multi-completion and the functionality provided by function
;;  `completing-read-multiple' of standard Emacs library `crm.el'.
;;  The latter lets you complete multiple strings in the minibuffer,
;;  one at a time.  It involves ordinary Emacs prefix completion, and
;;  it uses the same set of completion candidates for each of the
;;  strings in the input.
;;
;;  By contrast, Icicles multi-completion completes each part of your
;;  input against a different set of completion candidates.  For
;;  example, when you use `icicle-vardoc', it completes the
;;  variable-name part of your input against the names of defined
;;  variables, and the variable-description part against the doc
;;  strings of defined variables.  Standard Emacs command
;;  `completing-read-multiple' lets you complete several different
;;  variable names at the same minibuffer prompt, but they each
;;  complete against the same set of variable names.
;;
;;  Multi-completion matches a list of regexps in parallel.  See also
;;  the description of `M-*', which matches a list of regexps in
;;  series: (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Progressive Completion").
;;  You can combine these features, of course.
;;
;;(@* "Sorting Candidates by Their Second Part")
;;  ** Sorting Candidates by Their Second Part **
;;
;;  Most multi-completions have two parts.  Typically, the first part
;;  is the main part, that is, the part that you will most frequently
;;  complete against.  Many candidate sort orders involve some flavor
;;  of alphabetic order, and this means alphabetizing first with
;;  respect to the first multi-completion part.
;;
;;  However, it can sometimes be convenient to sort instead by the
;;  second part first.  That is what the Icicles sort order "by 2nd
;;  parts alphabetically" is for.  You can use it, for example, with
;;  command `icicle-locate-file' to sort file-name candidates first by
;;  date, and then by file-name for the same date.  This gives you an
;;  easy way to look up files that you modified during a given time
;;  period.  For example, your input regexp can limit candidates to
;;  those files last modified sometime in July, 2008, and you can then
;;  access these chronologically (by cycling or in buffer
;;  *Completions*).  And don't forget that you can always reverse the
;;  current sort order, using `C-N C-,' where N is an integer.

;;(@* "Dot, Dot, Dot")
;;
;;  Dot, Dot, Dot
;;  -------------
;;
;;  This section is about dot, that is, `.', and its role as a regexp
;;  special character in apropos completion.
;;
;;  Since the inception of regular-expression matching, `.' has
;;  matched any character *except* a newline character (aka `^J', aka
;;  `C-j').  Recent languages typically have an additional mode in
;;  which `.' can match any character, including a newline.  See, for
;;  example, http://www.regular-expressions.info/dot.html and this
;;  language comparison for regexp features:
;;  http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html.
;;
;;  It is not unusual to manipulate multi-line completion candidates
;;  in Icicles, in which case it can be handy to let `.' match any
;;  character, including a newline.  For this and more general
;;  reasons, I long ago requested such a mode for Emacs, but there was
;;  little interest in implementing it.  In Emacs, dot never matches a
;;  newline.  Too bad.
;;
;;  The regexp `\(.\|[\n]\)' is good enough, of course: it matches any
;;  character: any character any except newline, plus newline.  But it
;;  is a bit unwieldly, especially when used within a larger regexp,
;;  and especially if used more than once in the same regexp.
;;  Interactively, you input the `\n' using `C-j', and it appears in
;;  the minibuffer as a newline character; that is, it creates another
;;  line of input.
;;
;;  For convenience in multi-line matching, I added a *multi-line
;;  dot*, or dot-matches-newline-too, hack to Icicles.  This feature
;;  is turned off, by default.  You can toggle it on/off, using
;;  command `icicle-toggle-dot', which is bound to `C-M-.' in the
;;  minibuffer during completion.
;;
;;  When it is turned on, `.' is highlighted in the minibuffer (using
;;  face `highlight'), and it matches newlines also.  In fact,
;;  although it appears as just a highlighted dot, the ugly regexp
;;  `\(.\|[\n]\)' is really used, under the covers.  Icicles takes
;;  care of things so that you can edit normally (delete and transpose
;;  characters, etc.): A multi-line `.' acts just like a normal,
;;  single character, even though it is really a string of ten
;;  characters.
;;
;;  If you prefer to see the full regexp, `\(.\|[\n]\)', but
;;  highlighted, then set option `icicle-dot-show-regexp-flag' to
;;  non-nil.  (In Emacs 20, the newline-matching dot is always shown
;;  as that full regexp.)  If you prefer to turn on newline matching
;;  by default, then just customize option `icicle-dot-string'.
;;
;;  This match-anything dot is handy, but sometimes you might want to
;;  match anything except a newline, perhaps in the same input pattern
;;  where you also want to match any character (possibly a newline) at
;;  other positions.  How can you get the plain dot behavior, when
;;  multi-line dot is turned on?
;;
;;  One way is just to use a regexp that matches anything except
;;  newline: `[^\n]' (which you input using `[ ^ C-j ]').  Another way
;;  is to use a plain prefix argument: `C-u .'.  (A numeric prefix
;;  argument N inserts N multi-line dots, each of which matches any
;;  single character.)
;;
;;  `C-u' flips the behavior of `.' when you hit it: If by default `.'
;;  enters a multi-line dot, then `C-u .' enters a plain dot.  If by
;;  default `.' enters a plain dot, then `C-u .' enters a multi-line
;;  dot.  So `C-u' also gives you a way to enter a one-off multi-line
;;  dot, if you prefer to generally have `.' not match a newline.
;;  Either way, what you see in the minibuffer is the single character
;;  `.', highlighted if it is a multi-line dot, unhighlighted if it is
;;  a plain dot.
;;
;;  Multi-line dots are converted to plain dots automatically when you
;;  use prefix completion.  And if you then move back to apropos
;;  completion during the same completion operation, you get back any
;;  multi-line dots you had before, and any plain dots that you
;;  entered before remain plain.
;;
;;  So when is a multi-line dot useful?  Whenever you want to match
;;  against multi-line candidates.  Typical use cases include
;;  `icicle-search' and the Icicles doc commands, `icicle-vardoc',
;;  `icicle-fundoc', and `icicle-doc'.
 
;;(@* "Fuzzy Completion")
;;
;;  Fuzzy Completion
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  There are a few different kinds of what might be called "fuzzy"
;;  matching used in Icicles completion, in addition to apropos
;;  (regexp) matching and prefix matching.
;;
;;  * Fuzzy - This method uses a fairly sophisticated matching
;;    algorithm that seems to account for various typing mistakes.
;;    This algorithm is provided by library `fuzzy-match.el', so I
;;    call its use in Icicles `fuzzy' completion.  You must have
;;    library `fuzzy-match.el' to use this.
;;
;;  * Swank - Symbols are completed using the algorithm of
;;    `el-swank-fuzzy.el' - see that library for details.
;;
;;  * Scatter - This is a simple, poor man's fuzzy matching method
;;    that I call `scatter' matching.  Ido calls it `flex' matching.
;;    The TextMate editor has the same thing for file-name matching
;;    (only), without naming it.
;;
;;  * Levenshtein - This method checks whether two strings differ by
;;    at most a given number of character operations, the so-called
;;    "Levenshtein distance".
;;
;;  You can use fuzzy or swank completion in place of prefix
;;  completion (`TAB').  You can use the scatter or Levenshtein
;;  completion in place of apropos completion (`S-TAB').  You can
;;  change completion methods easily at any time, by hitting a key in
;;  the minibuffer:
;;
;;  * `C-(' (command `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method') to cycle
;;    among `TAB' completion methods: `basic', `vanilla', `fuzzy', and
;;    `swank' (`vanilla' only for Emacs 23 and later; `fuzzy' only if
;;    you have library `fuzzy-match.el'; `swank' only if you have
;;    library `el-swank-fuzzy.el').
;;
;;  * `M-(' (command `icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method') to cycle
;;    `S-TAB' completion methods: `apropos', `scatter', `Levenshtein'
;;    and `Levenshtein strict'.
;;
;;  Repeating `C-(' and `TAB' or `M-(' and `S-TAB' on the fly for the
;;  same input can be a good way to learn the differences between the
;;  various completion methods.
;;
;;  My opinion about the relative usefulness of the various methods:
;;  Basic (prefix) completion and apropos completion are by far the
;;  most useful.  They are followed, in order of decreasing
;;  usefulness, by scatter, fuzzy, Levenshtein, vanilla, and swank
;;  completion. YMMV.
;;
;;  Besides these methods, remember that you can get ordinary
;;  substring matching with `S-TAB' by using `C-`' to turn off
;;  (toggle) escaping of regexp special characters.  With special
;;  characters escaped, `S-TAB' does literal substring completion.
;;
;;  The type of completion matching that is used when you hit `S-TAB'
;;  and `TAB' is controlled by user options
;;  `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist' and
;;  `icicle-TAB-completion-methods', respectively.  By default, the
;;  first method in each list is used for matching.
;;
;;(@* "Partial Completion")
;;  ** Partial Completion **
;;
;;  This section pertains to Emacs releases starting with Emacs 23.
;;
;;  If option `icicle-TAB-completion-methods' includes `vanilla'
;;  (which it does, by default), and you choose `vanilla' completion
;;  for `TAB' (by cycling using `C-(' or by customizing
;;  `icicle-TAB-completion-methods' to use `vanilla' as the default),
;;  then Icicles `TAB' completion respects the standard Emacs option
;;  `completion-styles', so the behavior of `TAB' is similar to what
;;  it is in vanilla Emacs.
;;
;;  Emacs includes `partial-completion' in the default value of
;;  `completion-styles'.  This means that Icicles too will make use of
;;  partial completion when you use `TAB' (with `vanilla').  Icicles
;;  makes no use of `completion-styles' when you use `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  Partial completion is not really a kind of fuzzy completion, but
;;  its effect can sometimes be similar.  In some ways, it is similar
;;  to scatter-match completion (see next), but it requires you to
;;  explicitly mark where to skip ahead (using `*', ` ' (space), or
;;  `-').
;;
;;  Icicles does not support using the mode `partial-completion-mode',
;;  and Emacs itself is in the process of deprecating it, now that the
;;  partial-completion style is active by default.
;;
;;  I do not necessarily recommend using `vanilla' for `TAB'
;;  completion, or, if you do, including `partial-completion' as an
;;  entry in `completion-styles', because its effect is often
;;  counter-intuitive or confusing.  But it is included by default in
;;  Emacs, and Icicles supports it.  You might find it useful in
;;  file-name completion, to be able to complete directory components,
;;  for instance.
;;
;;(@* "Scatter-Match Completion")
;;  ** Scatter-Match Completion **
;;
;;  The idea behind scatter-match completion is very simple: input
;;  characters are matched in order against completion candidates, but
;;  possibly with intervening characters.  That is, your input
;;  scatter-matches a completion candidate if each character is also
;;  in the candidate, and the character order is respected.
;;
;;  What this really amounts to is matching input `abc' as if it were
;;  the regexp `a.*b.*c'.  That's all.
;;
;;  You can use Icicles scatter matching at any time in place of
;;  apropos (regexp) matching.  Unlike the cases of swank and fuzzy
;;  completion (see below), you can use it to complete file names
;;  also.
;;
;;(@* "Swank (Fuzzy Symbol) Completion")
;;  ** Swank (Fuzzy Symbol) Completion **
;;
;;  If you choose `swank' completion, what you get in Icicles is fuzzy
;;  completion (see next), except regarding symbols.  That is, swank
;;  completion per se applies only to symbols.  Symbols are completed
;;  using the algorithm of `el-swank-fuzzy.el' - see that library for
;;  details.
;;
;;  Icicles options `icicle-swank-timeout' and
;;  `icicle-swank-prefix-length' give you some control over the
;;  behavior.  When the `TAB' completion method is `swank', you can
;;  use `C-x 1' (`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-timeout+') and `C-x 2'
;;  (`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-prefix-length+') in the minibuffer
;;  to increment these options on the fly using the arrow keys `up'
;;  and `down'.
;;
;;  Swank symbol completion uses heuristics that relate to supposedly
;;  typical patterns found in symbol names.  It also uses a timeout
;;  that can limit the number of matches.  It is generally quite a bit
;;  slower than fuzzy completion, and it sometimes does not provide
;;  all candidates that you might think should match, even when all of
;;  your input is a prefix (or even when it is already complete!).
;;
;;  If swank completion produces no match when you think it should,
;;  remember that you can use `C-(' on the fly to change the
;;  completion method.
;;
;;  I do not necessarily recommend swank symbol completion, but it is
;;  available for those who appreciate it.
;;
;;  Like fuzzy completion (see next), swank completion always sorts
;;  candidate symbols according to its own scoring, putting what it
;;  thinks are the best matches first.  This means that using `C-,' in
;;  the minibuffer to sort candidates differently has no effect.
;;
;;(@* "Fuzzy-Match Completion")
;;  ** Fuzzy-Match Completion **
;;
;;  Fuzzy completion takes more explaining.  It is described in detail
;;  in the commentary of library `fuzzy-match.el'; please refer to
;;  that documentation.  Here are some things to keep in mind when you
;;  use Icicles fuzzy completion:
;;
;;  * File-name completion is never fuzzy.  Basic prefix completion is
;;    used for file names.
;;  * Fuzzy completion is always case-sensitive.  This means that
;;    `C-A' in the minibuffer has no effect on fuzzy completion.
;;  * Fuzzy completion always takes a space prefix in your input into
;;    account.  This means that `M-_' in the minibuffer has no effect
;;    on fuzzy completion.
;;  * Fuzzy completion candidates are always sorted by decreasing
;;    match strength.  This means that using `C-,' in the minibuffer
;;    to sort candidates differently has no effect.
;;
;;  Fuzzy completion is a form of prefix completion in which some
;;  input characters might not be present in a matched candidate.
;;  Matching finds the candidates that have the most characters in
;;  common with your input, in the same order and with a minimum of
;;  non-matching characters.  It can skip over non-matching
;;  characters, as long as the number of characters skipped in the
;;  candidate is less that those following them that match.  After the
;;  matching candidates are found, they are sorted by skip length and
;;  then candidate length.
;;
;;  Here are some examples:
;;
;;  Input         Completion Domain  Matches (Candidates)
;;  -----         -----------------  --------------------
;;
;;  abc           {xxabcxx, xabcxxx,
;;                          xabx}    {xabcxxx, xxabcxx}
;;
;;  point-mx      Emacs variables    {point-max, point-max-marker}
;;
;;  begining-of-l Emacs commands     {beginning-of-line,
;;                                    beginning-of-line-text,
;;                                    move-beginning-of-line,
;;                                    widget-beginning-of-line}
;;
;;  The last example shows that although fuzzy matching is a kind of
;;  prefix matching, your input is not necessarily a prefix of each
;;  matching candidate.  It is prefix matching because it tries to
;;  match your input starting at its beginning.  This input prefix is
;;  matched against candidate substrings, not necessarily candidate
;;  prefixes, but the non-matching part (if any) preceding the matched
;;  substring must not be longer than the matching part.  That is,
;;  non-matching substrings can be skipped over, but they must be no
;;  longer than the matching substrings that follow them.  If an input
;;  prefix does not match under these conditions, it is skipped over.
;;
;;  After matching an input prefix this way, the same process is
;;  repeated, recursively, for input text following that prefix and
;;  for match positions following the matches found.  That is, after
;;  each such prefix match, the process starts again where it left off
;;  in both the input and the candidates.  The resulting matches
;;  contain one or more substrings of your input that are each at
;;  least as long as the non-matching parts that immediately precede
;;  them.  Only matches with the highest number of matching characters
;;  are retained.  They are sorted by two criteria: (1) nearness of
;;  matches to the start of the candidate and (2) candidate length.
;;
;;  The fuzzy-match algorithm is detailed in library `fuzzy-match.el'.
;;  However, it is easier to get a feel for what it does by trying it
;;  than by reading any description.  Just give it a try.  Do not
;;  expect it to rival apropos completion in power or expressivity,
;;  however.  Instead, think of it as prefix completion for lazy or
;;  inaccurate typists!  If that sounds like you, then you might find
;;  it useful.
;;
;;  As an example, here are some command-name candidates for the input
;;  `fo' (there are lots more):
;;
;;  fortune          forms-mode       focus-frame
;;  follow-mode      forward-sexp     forward-list
;;  forward-word     forward-line     forward-page
;;  ...
;;  ifconfig         info             Info-up
;;  Info-edit        Info-next        Info-help
;;  ...
;;  Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node    Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node
;;
;;  And here are all the command-name candidates for the input `fol':
;;
;;  follow-mode            follow-delete-other-windows-and-split
;;  Info-last              info-lookup-file       info-lookup-reset
;;  Info-last-preorder     info-lookup-symbol     Info-last-menu-item
;;  nnfolder-generate-active-file     mh-folder-mode
;;
;;  The first thing to notice is the distribution of candidates for
;;  input `fo'.  Candidates are in decreasing order of match fit:
;;
;;  * The nearer the match to the start of the candidate, the better
;;    the fit.
;;
;;  * The greater the ratio of matched text to unmatched text, the
;;    better the fit.
;;
;;  Note too the candidate `ifconfig'.  First, note that it has no
;;  strict match for substring `fo'.  Its match is in fact in two
;;  parts: `f', then `o'.  Second, note that it is considered a better
;;  fuzzy match than the candidate `info'.  This is because its match
;;  (`f') is nearer to the start of the candidate (second character,
;;  versus third).
;;
;;  The second thing to notice is that when you type the third input
;;  character, `l', the candidates are not a subset of the original
;;  set that matches `fo'.  The candidates in the second screenshot
;;  all match `fol' in a fuzzy way, even though one of them,
;;  `mh-folder-mode', does not match `fo' sufficiently well to be
;;  included as a candidate.  Why?  Because in the `fo' case, the
;;  match is only two characters long and it starts after three
;;  non-matching characters.
;;
;;  For both inputs: If all input prefixes are fair game for matching,
;;  why doesn't `*Completions*' also include other command names that
;;  match only the prefix `f' and nothing else?  Because there is at
;;  least one match that matches more than that - only the best
;;  matches are retained.  In this case, the best matches for input
;;  `fo' match both the `f' and the `o', and the best matches for
;;  input `fol' match all three of those characters.
;;
;;  Refer to `fuzzy-match.el' for a precise description of fuzzy
;;  matching.  It refers to "matchiness" for how many characters match
;;  and "closeness" for the ratio of number of characters matched to
;;  candidate length.
;;
;;  Note: It is not practical to try to highlight the exact candidate
;;  portions that match different parts of your input.  Because
;;  fuzzy-match input does not function as a literal string for
;;  matching purposes, it is more akin to substring matching than to
;;  plain prefix matching.  For this reason, regexp-match highlighting
;;  is used for fuzzy matching.  That is why you see the input `fo'
;;  highlighted in `*Completions*' candidates in other than just the
;;  prefix position.  It is also why the matching `f' and `o' in
;;  candidate `ifconfig' are not highlighted: for highlighting
;;  purposes, your input is treated as a regexp.
;;
;;  One takeaway here is that fuzzy completion is complicated.  Rather
;;  than try to understand how it works and think ahead in those
;;  terms, you just need to get a feel for it - learn by doing.  Have
;;  fun!
;;
;;(@* "Levenshtein-Match Completion")
;;  ** Levenshtein-Match Completion **
;;
;;  The "Levenshtein distance" is the maximum number of character
;;  insertions, deletions, or replacements that are needed to
;;  transform one string to another.  The more similar two strings
;;  are, the smaller their Levenshtein distance.
;;
;;  When this kind of completion is used, Icicles considers your input
;;  to match a completion candidate if their Levenshtein distance is
;;  no greater than the value of option `icicle-levenshtein-distance'.
;;  The default value of the option is 1, meaning that the difference
;;  is at most one character operation.
;;
;;  Using a strict definition of the distance, this also requires the
;;  length of your input to be within the Levenshtein distance of the
;;  length of a completion candidate, for it to match.  That is quite
;;  restrictive.
;;
;;  It is more flexible to consider your input to match a candidate if
;;  it is within `icicle-levenshtein-distance' of some *substring* of
;;  the candidate.  Because candidate substrings are tested, the
;;  length of your input need not be nearly the same as the candidate
;;  length.
;;
;;  When you cycle among `S-TAB' completion methods using `M-(', there
;;  are thus two choices for Levenshtein completion: `Levenshtein' and
;;  `Levenshtein strict'.  The former is generally more useful.
;;
;;  The larger the value of `icicle-levenshtein-distance', the slower
;;  Levenshtein completion becomes, since it must test more
;;  possibilities.  Also, when the value is 1 (except for `Levenshtein
;;  strict'), Icicles uses a fast, special-case algorithm, and it
;;  highlights the matching parts of candidates in buffer
;;  `*Completions*'.  1 is the most useful value.
;;
;;  If the value is other than 1 (or if it is 1 with `Levenshtein
;;  strict'), then you must also use library `levenshtein.el', and
;;  Levenshtein completion can be quite slow.  In that case, you will
;;  no doubt want to turn off incremental completion (`C-#').

;;
;;  Completion in Other Buffers
;;  ---------------------------
;;
;;  In addition to input completion, you can use Icicles to complete
;;  words and symbols in other buffers, besides the minibuffer.
;;  Icicles enhances this completion in these ways:
;;
;;  1. Lisp symbol completion via `M-TAB' (`lisp-complete-symbol').
;;     (This is also `ESC-TAB' and `C-M-i'.)
;;
;;  2. Word completion using the dynamic abbreviation of standard
;;     Emacs library `dabbrev.el', via `C-M-/'.
;;
;;  3. Mailing information completion for BBDB (Insidious Big Brother
;;     Database).
;;
;;  4. Word completion using the words and phrases in a thesaurus, via
;;     `C-c /' (requires library `synonyms.el').
;;
;;  5. `TAB' completion of the following in Shell mode and ESS modes
;;     (and other, similar interpreters):
;;
;;     * Commands
;;     * Previous inputs - commands plus their arguments
;;     * File names
;;     * Environment variables
;;
;;  Whenever multiple completion candidates are available, you can use
;;  Icicles completion, with all of its features: cycling of
;;  candidates (`TAB', `down', or `next'), apropos (regexp) completion
;;  (`S-TAB'), progressive completion (`M-SPC'), help on individual
;;  candidates (`C-M-RET'), and so on.
;;
;;(@* "Dynamic Abbreviation")
;;  ** Dynamic Abbreviation **
;;
;;  Library `dabbrev.el' lets you type a few characters in a buffer
;;  and then prefix-complete them (in the same buffer) to a full word
;;  or symbol name.  The completion candidates come from words or
;;  symbol names in buffers that you are editing.  This functionality
;;  is called "dynamic abbreviation", though that is not a very good
;;  term for it (words are completed, not abbreviated, dynamically).
;;
;;  In Emacs, there are two ways to "dynamically abbreviate" text:
;;
;;  a. `M-/' (command `dabbrev-expand') completes to a candidate word.
;;     Repeating it replaces the completion with a different one -
;;     that is, it cycles candidates in the text buffer (not in the
;;     minibuffer).
;;
;;  b. `C-M-/' (command `dabbrev-completion') completes to the common
;;     prefix of all matching completion candidates.  Repeating it
;;     displays buffer `*Completions*' for you to choose a candidate.
;;     However, in this case, there is no way to cycle among the
;;     candidates.
;;
;;  If there are many candidate completions, then cycling among them
;;  with `M-/' can be tedious.  You can use `C-M-/' to complete to a
;;  common prefix, thus narrowing the set of candidates, but then you
;;  lose the ability to cycle among them.
;;
;;  If user option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' is non-nil
;;  (which is the case by default), then Icicles redefines command
;;  `dabbrev-completion' (it does not change `dabbrev-expand') so that
;;  it uses Icicles completion when there are multiple completions.
;;  You can use any Icicles features, such as apropos completion and
;;  candidate cycling.  In addition, you can even complete an empty
;;  prefix, starting from scratch with apropos completion.
;;
;;(@* "BBDB Completion")
;;  ** BBDB Completion **
;;
;;  Library `bbdb.el', available at http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/, is a
;;  rolodex-like database program for GNU Emacs.
;;
;;  If user option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' is non-nil
;;  (which is the case by default), then Icicles redefines command
;;  `bbdb-complete-name' so that it uses Icicles completion when there
;;  are multiple completions.  You can use any Icicles features, such
;;  as apropos completion and candidate cycling.  For this feature to
;;  take effect, you must load BBDB before you load Icicles.
;;
;;(@* "Thesaurus Completion")
;;  ** Thesaurus Completion **
;;
;;  Library `synonyms.el' provides various features for defining a
;;  thesaurus and looking up words and phrases in it.  Command
;;  `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' takes advantage of these
;;  features.  You can use it to complete a word in a text buffer to
;;  any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  With the default value of
;;  option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings', this is bound to `C-c /'
;;  in Icicle mode.
;;
;;  Tip: You can use `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' to quickly
;;  check the spelling of a word.  If it is correctly spelled, then it
;;  appears as a complete completion (is highlighted as such in the
;;  minibuffer).
;;
;;  Another Icicles command that uses the thesaurus is
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'.  It lets you use Icicles
;;  completion, cycling, and so on to insert thesaurus words and
;;  phrases in any buffer.  It does not complete the word at point.
;;  It is a multi-command (see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands")), so you
;;  can, within a single call to it, insert any number of thesaurus
;;  entries, in succession.  If you wanted to, you could write an
;;  entire book using a single call to
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!
;;
;;  Both commands, `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' and
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry', require that you first load
;;  library `synonyms.el'.  See library `synonyms.el' for more
;;  information.

;;(@* "Completion in Comint Modes")
;;  ** Completion in Comint Modes **
;;
;;  `TAB' in a shell or similar buffer provides Icicles completion for
;;  command names, file names, and environment variables that are

;;
;;  You can also complete input using your previous inputs as the set
;;  of candidates.  Just type something at the prompt, hit `C-c `',
;;  and pick one or more previous inputs to execute again (this uses

;;  re-execute the exact same shell command; you can edit your
;;  previous input before hitting `RET' to enter the command.
;;
;;  These features are available for Comint mode and several modes

;;(@* "Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode")
;;  ** Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode **
;;
;;  Icicles works especially well with Delete Selection mode, which I
;;  use and recommend.  (Likewise, for PC selection mode, which uses
;;  Delete Selection mode.)  In Delete Selection mode, whenever the
;;  region (selection) is active (highlighted), you can simply type to
;;  replace text in the region, or hit `DEL' (Backspace) or `C-d'
;;  (Delete) to delete the region.
;;
;;  However, library `delsel.el', which provides Delete Selection
;;  mode, binds keys in minibuffer maps that are also bound by
;;  Icicles.  For this reason, if you use both Icicles and Delete
;;  Selection mode, you must turn on Icicle mode after you turn on
;;  Delete Selection mode.  If you forget to do this, you will notice
;;  that `C-g' does not abort minibuffer input.  The remedy is simply
;;  to turn Icicle mode off, then on again.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles User Options and Faces")
;;  ** Icicles User Options and Faces **
;;
;;  There are several user options (user variables) and faces that
;;  Icicles defines, and you can also use various standard user
;;  options, including Icomplete options, that control various aspects
;;  of completion.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-mode-hook' is a normal hook containing
;;    functions that are run after entering and exiting Icicle mode.
;;    This is nil, by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook' is a list of
;;    functions to be run at the end of minibuffer setup for Icicle
;;    mode.  This is nil, by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-update-input-hook' is a list of functions to
;;    be run when minibuffer input is updated (typing or deleting).
;;    This is nil, by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-no-match-hook' is a list of functions to be
;;    run during completion (`TAB' or `S-TAB') when there are no
;;    completion candidates that match the current input.  This is
;;    nil, by default.
;;
;;  * Case sensitivity: The following standard user options control
;;    whether completion distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase
;;    letters:
;;
;;    * `completion-ignore-case'
;;    * `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' (Emacs 22 and later)
;;    * `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case' (Emacs 23 and later)
;;
;;    In addition, you can toggle case-sensitivity at any time using
;;    `C-A' (that is, `C-S-a') in the minibuffer.  This toggles
;;    `case-fold-search' and `completion-ignore-case'.  With a prefix
;;    argument, it also toggles
;;    `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' and
;;    `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case'.
;;
;;    More precisely, it toggles the default value of
;;    `case-fold-search', and then it sets the other variables to the
;;    value of `case-fold-search'.  Because the default value of
;;    `case-fold-search' is changed, all buffers are affected.  Note
;;    that because some Icicles commands bind one or more of these
;;    variables, toggling case-sensitivity during command execution
;;    will not necessarily toggle their global values.
;;
;;    You can tell whether completion is currently case-sensitive by
;;    looking at the Icicle minor-mode lighter in the mode line, if
;;    `icicle-highlight-lighter-flag' is non-nil.  If case-sensitive,
;;    then the lighter text (with or without multi-command symbol `+')
;;    is `Icy'; if not, it is `ICY'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-region-background',
;;    `icicle-point-position-in-candidate',
;;    `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate', and
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' are all used to define
;;    the region (the selected text) when cycling completion
;;    candidates.  They are described below individually.  The region
;;    is active when cycling, so you can easily delete it or replace
;;    it.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-point-position-in-candidate' defines the
;;    minibuffer cursor position (point) while cycling candidate
;;    completions.  By default, the cursor is placed at the end of the
;;    root being completed.  You can instead place it at the root
;;    beginning or at the beginning or end of the complete minibuffer
;;    input.  For file-name input, the beginning of minibuffer input
;;    starts after the directory name (which is inserted
;;    automatically).
;;
;;  * Similarly, user option `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate'
;;    defines the position of the mark; by default, it is at the end
;;    of the input.  Together, these two options control the size and
;;    placement of the region in a flexible way.  You can make the
;;    region include all of the input, only the root, from beginning
;;    to root, or from root to end.  You can put the cursor at either
;;    end of the region.  You can get rid of the region altogether, by
;;    making point and mark coincide (at any of the possible
;;    positions).
;;
;;  * Because the region background color is often quite different
;;    from the frame background color (in order to have it stand out),
;;    it can be a bit hard to read the completion candidates when the
;;    region is highlighted during input cycling.  If user option
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is non-nil, however, then
;;    the region background is changed to a color that differs only
;;    slightly from the frame background, making it easier to read the
;;    completion candidates.  The actual background color used is the
;;    value of `icicle-region-background', which you can customize.
;;    If you make this color the same as the frame background, then
;;    the region background is, in effect, invisible.
;;
;;  * The default value of `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is
;;    determined by the current value of `delete-selection-mode', that
;;    is, whether or not Delete Selection mode is enabled, when
;;    Icicles is loaded.  For this reason, if you use Delete Selection
;;    mode and you want the region background to change in the
;;    minibuffer, you should either turn on Delete Selection mode
;;    before loading `icicles.el' or explicitly customize
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' to non-nil.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-default-value' controls the treatment of a
;;    default value for minibuffer input.  This includes not only
;;    functions that read input with completion (`completing-read',
;;    `read-file-name'), but also other input-reading functions:
;;    `read-from-minibuffer' and `read-string'.  The default value of
;;    t gives the vanilla Emacs behavior: `completing-read' adds the
;;    default input value to the prompt as a hint (but
;;    `read-file-name' does not).  Non-nil and non-t means to
;;    automatically insert the default input value into the minibuffer
;;    as the initial value.  I prefer to have it inserted, as I often
;;    use the default value (perhaps editing it).  A value of nil
;;    neither inserts the default value nor adds it to the prompt.  If
;;    the value is t or nil, remember that you can always insert the
;;    default value manually with `M-n'.  If the value is neither t
;;    nor nil, you can always use `M-p' to remove the default value
;;    from the minibuffer.
;;
;;    A non-nil, non-t value of `icicle-default-value' controls also
;;    whether or not the initial value is preselected, and where to
;;    leave the cursor: at the beginning or end of the value.
;;    Preselecting the value can be useful in Delete Selection mode or
;;    PC Selection mode, because it makes it easy to replace that
;;    value by typing characters, or delete it by hitting `DEL'
;;    (Backspace) or `C-d' (Delete).  However, all of the initial
;;    input is lost if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL', which is
;;    inconvenient if you want to edit it only slightly.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' and
;;    `icicle-default-thing-insertion' control the behavior of `M-.'
;;    in the minibuffer, which grabs text from the current buffer and
;;    yanks it into the minibuffer.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor")
;;    and the doc string (`C-h v') of
;;    `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' for more information.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements'
;;    specifies a list of function replacements for
;;    `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete' to replace the functions in
;;    `comint-dynamic-complete-functions'.  You can use this to
;;    provide Icicles completion for various modes that inherit from
;;    Comint mode.  By default, it treats Comint mode and Shell mode.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-input-string' is a regexp string that is
;;    inserted in the minibuffer when you use `C-='.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Inserting a Regexp from a Variable or Register").
;;
;;  * In buffer `*Completions*', face `icicle-saved-candidate'
;;    highlights candidates that have been saved, face
;;    `icicle-current-candidate-highlight' highlights the current
;;    completion candidate, and, provided user option
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag' is non-nil, face
;;    `icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions' highlights the
;;    expanded common match among all completions.  Faces
;;    `icicle-match-highlight-Completions' and
;;    `icicle-match-highlight-minibuffer' highlight whatever your
;;    input matches, in buffer `*Completions*' and in the minibuffer,
;;    respectively.  In the minibuffer, face `icicle-complete-input'
;;    highlights your input when it is complete.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag' means
;;    that Icicles will not add menu items to menu-bar menus, except
;;    for the Icicles and Minibuf menus.  Default value nil means that
;;    whenever an appropriate menu-bar menu exists, Icicles items are
;;    added to it (when in Icicle mode).  For example, if nil, then
;;    Delete File is added to the File menu; otherwise it is added to
;;    the Icicles menu.  The value of this option is used only when
;;    Icicle mode is initially established, so changing it has no
;;    effect after Icicles has been loaded.  However, you can change
;;    it and save the new value, so it will be used next time.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-redefine-standard-commands-flag' controls
;;    whether Icicles redefines some standard commands, enhancing them
;;    to use Icicles completion.  A non-nil value causes redefinition.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-inhibit-advice-functions' is a list of functions
;;    that Icicles redefines, and for which Icicle mode deactivates
;;    the advice.  The advice for each is reactivated when you leave
;;    Icicle mode.  Generally, it is a bad idea to use advice with
;;    functions that Icicles redefines, in particular minibuffer
;;    functions.  If you want to allow some such advice or prohibit
;;    advice for additional functions, then customize this list.
;;
;;    Note: If you or a library you load advises one of these
;;    functions while you are in Icicle mode, then toggle Icicle mode
;;    twice, so that this option can have the proper effect.
;;
;;  * The following user options specify the keys to use for
;;    completion-candidate cycling:
;;
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys'            (cycle)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys'                (cycle)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'             (cycle)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys'                 (cycle)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-action-keys'     (cycle, act)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-action-keys'         (cycle, act)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-action-keys'      (cycle, act)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-action-keys'          (cycle, act)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-alt-action-keys' (cycle, alt act)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-alt-action-keys'     (cycle, alt act)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-alt-action-keys'  (cycle, alt act)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-alt-action-keys'      (cycle, alt act)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-help-keys'       (cycle, help)
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-help-keys'           (cycle, help)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-help-keys'        (cycle, help)
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-help-keys'            (cycle, help)
;;
;;    By default, these keys are, respectively, `prior', `next', `up',
;;    `down', `C-prior', `C-next', `C-up', `C-down', `C-S-prior',
;;    `C-S-next', `C-S-up', `C-S-down', `C-M-prior', `C-M-next',
;;    `C-M-up', and `C-M-down'.
;;
;;    The keys defined by options `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'
;;    and `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys' are used also to move up or
;;    down a line in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode' causes
;;    the modal cycling keys to act differently during completion.
;;    Those keys are `up', `down', `C-up', and `C-down' by default,
;;    but they are configurable by user options
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-alt-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-help-keys', `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-alt-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-help-keys', and
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys'.
;;
;;    The completion mode, and hence the behavior of these keys, is
;;    changed whenever you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' during completion: the
;;    mode is prefix completion after `TAB' and apropos completion
;;    after `S-TAB'.
;;
;;    Before you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', the cycling behavior depends on
;;    the particular non-nil value of the option:
;;
;;    - `prefix'  means cycle prefix completions
;;    - `apropos' means cycle apropos completions
;;    - Other non-nil value means cycle inputs from the input history
;;
;;    For example, if the value is `apropos' then you can immediately
;;    cycle apropos completions without first hitting `S-TAB'.
;;
;;    Once you have used `TAB' or `S-TAB', the only way to traverse
;;    the input history is to use `M-p' and `M-n' (`up' and `down'
;;    will cycle completions).
;;
;;    If the option is non-nil you can still use `M-p' and `M-n' to
;;    traverse the input history, and `prior' and `next' to cycle
;;    apropos completions (assuming that those default keys have not
;;    been changed).  And if you customize either the modal cycling
;;    keys or the prefix cycling keys so that they are different
;;    (e.g. one of those sets is no longer `up'/`down'), then you can
;;    also still use the latter.  In this case, you need not use `TAB'
;;    and `S-TAB' to switch between the two completion types, even
;;    when this option is non-nil - you can use the separate apropos
;;    and prefix cycling keys.
;;
;;  * The values of user options `icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-alt-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-help-keys', `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-alt-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-help-keys', and
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys', are the keys used for modal
;;    cycling.  By default, these keys are `C-up', `C-S-up', `C-M-up',
;;    `up', `C-down', `C-S-down', `C-M-down', and `down'.  These
;;    options have an effect only if option
;;    `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode' is non-nil.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-word-completion-keys' is a list of keys to
;;    use for word completion.  By default, the only such key is
;;    `M-SPC'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys' is a list
;;    of keys to bind to `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display'.  By
;;    default, these keys are `C-M-S-tab' and `C-M-S-iso-lefttab',
;;    which together implement `C-M-S-TAB'.  Similarly,
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display'.  By default, the only such
;;    key is `C-M-tab'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-prefix-complete-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete'.  By default, these keys are `tab' and
;;    `C-i', which together implement `TAB'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-apropos-complete-keys' is the list of keys to
;;    bind to `icicle-apropos-complete'.  By default, these keys are
;;    `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', which together implement `S-TAB'.
;;    (In Emacs 22 and later, `backtab' is the canonical key that
;;    represents both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is used in
;;    the default value.)
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-key-complete-keys' is the list of keys to bind to
;;    `icicle-complete-keys'.  By default, these keys are `S-tab' and
;;    `S-iso-lefttab', which together implement `S-TAB'.  (In Emacs 22
;;    and later, `backtab' is the canonical key that represents both
;;    `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is used in the default
;;    value.)
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-previous-candidate-keys' is the list of keys to
;;    bind to `icicle-move-to-previous-completion', for moving among
;;    candidates in buffer `*Completions*'.  By default, these keys
;;    are `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', which together implement
;;    `S-TAB'.  (In Emacs 22 and later, `backtab' is the canonical key
;;    that represents both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is
;;    used in the default value.)
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-isearch-complete-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    `icicle-isearch-complete'.  By default, these keys are `M-TAB',
;;    `ESC TAB', `C-M-TAB', and `M-o'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-read+insert-file-name-keys' is the list of keys
;;    for invoking file-name completion on demand.  By default,
;;    `C-M-S-f' is the only such key.  Option
;;    `icicle-completing-read+insert-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    invoking non file-name completion on demand.  By default,
;;    `C-M-S-c' is the only such key.  See (@> "Completion On Demand").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag' nil means that keys
;;    such as `C-next', which combine candidate action and cycling,
;;    cycle to the next (or previous) candidate and act on it.
;;    Non-nil means they act on the current candidate and then cycle
;;    to the next (or previous) candidate.  When the value is nil, you
;;    can think of `C-next' as an operation on the next candidate.
;;    When the value is non-nil, you can think of `C-next' as an
;;    operation on the current candidate, which ends by making the
;;    next candidate current.  Similarly for the other cycling keys
;;    that act, alternative-act, or show help on a candidate.  The
;;    default value is nil.  See also option
;;    `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', which changes the keys affected
;;    by `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag'.
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag' is nil, then the keys
;;    that cycle candidates are swapped with the keys that both cycle
;;    and act on a candidate.  You can then use `C-down', `C-up',
;;    `C-next', and `C-prior' to both cycle and act, and `down', `up',
;;    `next', and `prior' to merely cycle, without acting
;;    (e.g. navigating).  The option has no effect on other keys.  You
;;    can toggle this option at any time using `M-g'
;;    (`icicle-toggle-C-for-actions') in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    (The keys mentioned here are the default bindings.  The actual
;;    keys swapped are those defined by these user options:
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys',
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys', `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys'.)
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag'
;;    means that whenever there is only one completion candidate that
;;    matches your input, that candidate is used immediately, without
;;    requiring you to hit `RET' or `S-RET'.
;;
;;  * When `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag' is nil, option
;;    `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-delay' is the number of
;;    seconds Icicles waits, before returning to top level with the
;;    sole completion.  (It has no effect if the flag is nil.)  The
;;    delay gives you a chance to forestall acceptance of the sole
;;    completion: editing the completion (typing or deleting a
;;    character) before the delay expires prevents its automatic
;;    acceptance.  The default value is 0 seconds (no delay).
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-TAB-shows-candidates-flag' means
;;    that hitting `TAB' for prefix completion immediately shows the
;;    completion candidates in buffer `*Completions*'.  If nil, then
;;    candidates are shown only after `TAB' is hit a second time,
;;    which is the standard Emacs behavior.  The default value is t.
;;    (Actually, the concerned keys are those defined by option
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete-keys', not necessarily `TAB'.)
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-max-candidates' means truncate the list
;;    of completion candidates to at most this many.  If you use
;;    library `doremi.el' then you can use `C-x #' during completion
;;    to increment or decrement the option value using the vertical
;;    arrow keys or the mouse wheel.  A numeric prefix argument for
;;    `C-x #' sets the increment size.  A plain prefix argument
;;    (`C-u') resets `icicle-max-candidates' to nil, meaning no
;;    truncation.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag'
;;    means that completion commands `TAB' and `S-TAB' expand your
;;    minibuffer input to (typically) the longest substring common to
;;    all completion candidates and that matches your (complete) input
;;    pattern.  This replaces the input you typed.  If you want to
;;    edit your original, raw input, use `C-l'.  If your input has
;;    been expanded, then hit `C-l' twice: once to replace a
;;    completion candidate (from, say, `next') with the common match
;;    string, and a second time to replace the common match string
;;    with your original input.  The main reason you might want to set
;;    this to nil is for apropos completion, if you want to always
;;    work with a regexp in the minibuffer.  You can toggle this
;;    option at any time using `C-;' in the minibuffer.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Expanded-Common-Match Completion").
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option
;;    `icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag' hides the common
;;    match for your current input from each candidate in
;;    *Completions*.  You can toggle this at any time during
;;    completion using `C-x .' (`icicle-toggle-hiding-common-match').
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag' controls
;;    whether or not buffer `*Completions*' is shown initially,
;;    without your needing to hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to show it.
;;    However, if you type something before
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-delay', then display is
;;    inhibited.  The default value is nil, meaning that
;;    `*Completions*' is not shown until you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB'.
;;    More typical than setting this option to non-nil globally is to
;;    bind it to non-nil in Emacs-Lisp code, to display
;;    `*Completions*' as a menu.  For example, pass a non-nil binding
;;    to `icicle-define-command' to create a command that displays a
;;    multiple-choice menu.
;;
;;    For an alternative but similar behavior to using non-nil for
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag', you can set option
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' to a value that is neither
;;    nil nor t.  That displays `*Completions*' as soon as you type or
;;    delete input, but not initially.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' controls
;;    whether or not `*Completions*' is updated incrementally
;;    (icompletion) as you type.  You can toggle incremental
;;    completion at any time using `C-#'.  For more information, see
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icompletion").
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-incremental-completion-delay' and
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-threshold' together cause a delay
;;    before incremental completion takes effect.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icompletion").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars' is the
;;    minimum number of input characters that allow buffer
;;    `*Completions*' to remain displayed.  By default, this is zero
;;    (0), meaning that any number of input characters, even none,
;;    allows `*Completions*' to remain displayed.  If you use
;;    incremental completion (see `icicle-incremental-completion-*'),
;;    and you are bothered by `*Completions*' being automatically
;;    updated when, for instance, you empty the minibuffer, then you
;;    might want to set this option to, say, 1 or 2.  With a value of
;;    2, for instance, whenever the minibuffer input has less than 2
;;    characters, incremental completion will remove the
;;    `*Completions*' window.  You can also remove the `*Completions*'
;;    window at any time using `C-x 0' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-show-Completions-help-flag' means display
;;    help (instructions) at the top of the `*Completions*' window.
;;    These instructions are shown in faces
;;    `icicle-Completions-instruction-1' and
;;    `icicle-Completions-instruction-2'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-help-in-mode-line-flag' means display
;;    help on individual completion candidates in the mode-line as you
;;    cycle or your input is completed.  The mode-line used is that of
;;    buffer `*Completions*', if it is displayed, or the current
;;    buffer, otherwise.  Typically, this mode-line candidate help is
;;    the first line of a doc string, but alternative help is
;;    available.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-mode-line-help' is used to highlight Icicles help
;;    shown in the mode-line.  This includes that controlled by option
;;    `icicle-help-in-mode-line-flag' and the indication in
;;    `*Completions*' of the total number of matching candidates.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-frame-at-right-flag' controls
;;    whether `icicle-candidate-action' moves the frame showing buffer
;;    `*Completions*' to the right, out of the way of other frames.
;;    This can be useful if you use one-buffer-per-frame (non-nil
;;    `pop-up-frames').  In that case, I recommend that you also try
;;    my library `oneonone.el'.
;;    See (@> "Note on Non-nil `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows") for
;;    more advice about non-nil `pop-up-frames'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-window-max-height' is the
;;    maximum height of the `*Completions*' window, in lines.  The
;;    window is fit to the buffer size, with this as maximum height.
;;    This is not used if `*Completions*' is a special display buffer
;;    with its own frame, and it is not used in Emacs releases prior
;;    to 21.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23, you can use option
;;    `icicle-Completions-text-scale-decrease' to change the size of
;;    the text used in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-candidate-width-factor' controls how many
;;    columns of completion candidates are displayed in
;;    `*Completions*'.  The widest current candidate is scaled by this
;;    percentage, and the window width is divided by that figure.
;;    Other things are taken into account also, but this gives you a
;;    way to tweak the number of columns: the larger this number, the
;;    fewer the columns.
;;
;;    If you use Do Re Mi (library `doremi.el'), then you can modify
;;    `icicle-candidate-width-factor' incrementally during completion,
;;    seeing the effect as it changes.  Use `C-x w' from the
;;    minibuffer, then use the `right' and `left' arrow keys or the
;;    mouse wheel to increment and decrement the value.  You can at
;;    the same time use the `up' and `down' keys to adjust the value
;;    of `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces'.  WYSIWYG.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces' is the minimum
;;    number of spaces between candidates displayed in
;;    `*Completions*'.  The default value is one space.
;;
;;    If you use Do Re Mi (library `doremi.el'), then you can modify
;;    `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces' incrementally during
;;    completion, seeing the effect as it changes.  Use `C-x |' from
;;    the minibuffer, then use the `up' and `down' arrow keys or the
;;    mouse wheel to increment and decrement the value.  You can at
;;    the same time use the `left' and `right' keys to adjust the
;;    value of `icicle-candidate-width-factor'.  WYSIWYG.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-completions-format' controls whether candidates
;;    displayed in `*Completions*' are laid out horizontally (the
;;    default) or vertically.  Set the value to `vertical' for the
;;    latter.  Starting with Emacs 23.2, you can just use the vanilla
;;    option `completions-format' for this, if you want the same type
;;    of layout with Icicle mode turned on or off.
;;
;;    Multi-completions often involve complex, multi-line text for
;;    which a vertical `*Completions*' layout is not appropriate.  For
;;    this reason, when multi-line multi-completions are used the
;;    layout is horizontal, temporarily overriding any `vertical'
;;    value for `icicle-completions-format' or `completions-format'.
;;
;;    If you need to override this override behavior for some command,
;;    use `icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook' and `minibuffer-exit-hook' to
;;    temporarily set and reset the internal variable
;;    `icicle-completions-format-internal'.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-historical-candidate' is used to highlight
;;    completion candidates that you have used (entered with `RET')
;;    previously.  This highlighting is controlled by user option
;;    `icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag'.  You can toggle
;;    this option from the minibuffer at any time using `C-pause'.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag' is non-nil (the
;;    default), then commands that you invoke using the menu-bar menu
;;    are included in the command history for `M-x'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag' means
;;    that any interactive use of a command causes it to be added to
;;    the history `icicle-interactive-history'.  You can access this
;;    history by using `C-M-pause' during completion.  Be aware that
;;    addition of all interactive invocations to this history can slow
;;    Emacs down.  (This option is only available starting with Emacs
;;    23.)
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sort-comparer' controls the order of
;;    completion candidates during cycling and in buffer
;;    `*Completions*'.  If nil, then no sorting is done.  If non-nil,
;;    then the value must be a string-comparison function - the
;;    function is passed to the standard function `sort' to do the
;;    sorting.  The default value for `icicle-sort-comparer' is
;;    `icicle-case-string-less-p', which sorts alphabetically,
;;    possibly ignoring letter case.  During completion, you can
;;    toggle sorting using `C-,'.  If you are an Emacs-Lisp programmer
;;    and you write new commands using Icicles functionalities, you
;;    can bind `icicle-sort-comparer' temporarily to any sort function
;;    you need.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-alternative-sort-comparer' is an alternative
;;    to `icicle-sort-comparer, providing a different sort order.  By
;;    default, it is `icicle-historical-alphabetic-p', a function that
;;    sorts previously used completion candidates before candidates
;;    that have not yet been used, and sorts alphabetically within
;;    each of these groups of candidates.  In other words, it places
;;    inputs that you have used previously at the top of buffer
;;    `*Completions*' and makes them available for completion first.
;;    During completion, you can toggle normal and alternative sorting
;;    using `C-M-,'.  See (@> "Sorting Candidates") and
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-change-sort-order-completion-flag' specifies
;;    whether `C-,' cycles among available sort orders or lets you
;;    choose a sort order using Icicles completion.  Non-nil means to
;;    use completion; nil (the default value) means to cycle.  You can
;;    override the current setting at any time by using `C-u C-,'.
;;    See (@> "Sorting Candidates").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sort-orders-alist' is an alist of possible
;;    sort orders for user to choose from using `C-,' or `M-,'.
;;    See (@> "Sorting Candidates").
;;
;;  * The value of user option `icicle-transform-function' is a
;;    function that is applied to the list of completion candidates,
;;    to transform them before they are presented to the user.  If
;;    nil, then no transformation is done.  The default transformation
;;    is to remove duplicate candidates, when transformation is
;;    active, but the default value of this option is nil.  You can
;;    toggle transformation at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-transforming', bound to `C-$' in the minibuffer.
;;    Although this is a user option, you probably do *NOT* want to
;;    change its value by customizing it.  Icicles commands already
;;    "do the right thing" when it comes to candidate transformation.
;;
;;    The value of this option can be changed by program locally, for
;;    use in particular contexts.  For example, when you use
;;    `icicle-search-generic' (`C-c `') in a *shell* buffer, Icicles
;;    uses this variable with a value of `icicle-remove-duplicates',
;;    to remove duplicate shell commands from your input history list.
;;    Lisp programmers can use this variable to transform the list of
;;    candidates in any way they like.  A typical use is to remove
;;    duplicates, by binding it to `icicle-remove-duplicates' or
;;    `icicle-remove-dups-if-extras'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-require-match-flag',
;;    `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag', and
;;    `icicle-file-require-match-flag' let you override the value of
;;    the REQUIRE-MATCH argument provided to `completing-read' or
;;    `read-file-name'.  They are provided mainly for use (binding) in
;;    `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command', but
;;    you may also use them globally, if you wish.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation").
;;
;;    A typical use is made in the definition of command
;;    `icicle-buffer': `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag' is used to
;;    bind `icicle-require-match-flag', so that you can, for example,
;;    match only existing buffers and be able to match on partial
;;    input without explicitly completing (hitting `TAB' or `S-TAB').
;;    Simply set the option to `partial-match-ok' to get this
;;    behavior.  To apropos-complete and exit the minibuffer, use
;;    `S-RET' instead of `RET'.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation"),
;;    for more information.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' means to
;;    ignore completion candidates that start with a space.  However,
;;    such candidates are not ignored for prefix completion if the
;;    input also starts with a space.  Naturally, apropos completion
;;    is not affected by whether or not the input starts with a space.
;;
;;    Option `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag' lets you
;;    override the value of `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' for use
;;    with buffer-name completion (the names of internal buffers start
;;    with a space).  It is provided mainly for binding when using
;;    `icicle-define-command' (`icicle-buffer' does this).
;;
;;    You can toggle `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' at any time
;;    using `M-_' in the minibuffer.  If the current command binds
;;    this option locally, then it is the local, not the global, value
;;    that is changed.  For example, if
;;    `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag' is non-nil, then `M-_'
;;    toggles `icicle-ignore-space-prefix-flag' to nil only for the
;;    duration of the buffer command (e.g. `icicle-buffer').
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag' means
;;    that Icicles tests for remote file names; nil means that it does
;;    not.  You can toggle this using `C-^' in the minibuffer (except
;;    during Icicles search).  Turning off remote file-name testing
;;    means that you cannot use remote files with Tramp; it disables
;;    Tramp's remote file-name handling and completion.  This can, for
;;    local files, slightly speed up incremental completion and the
;;    highlighting of the part of your current input that does not
;;    complete (see `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure').
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-regexp-quote-flag' reduces apropos
;;    completion to simple substring completion and Icicles regexp
;;    search to literal search.  Regexp special characters are no
;;    longer recognized as special; they simply match themselves.  You
;;    probably do not want to customize this option.  Instead, you can
;;    toggle it at any time using `C-`' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-command-abbrev-match-all-parts-flag',
;;    `icicle-command-abbrev-priority-flag', and
;;    `icicle-command-abbrev-alist' control the behavior of
;;    multi-command `icicle-command-abbrev' (`C-x SPC').  The first
;;    determines whether an abbreviation must match all parts of a
;;    command name.  The second controls whether command names or
;;    abbreviations take precedence in case of conflict.  The third is
;;    the persistent list of your command abbreviations.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist' and
;;    `icicle-TAB-completion-methods' control which completion method
;;    is used by `S-TAB' and `TAB', respectively, to complete your
;;    input.  By default, the first method in each list is used for
;;    matching.  You can use `M-(' and `C-(' (commands
;;    `icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method' and
;;    `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method') in the minibuffer to cycle
;;    among the `S-TAB' and `TAB' methods.
;;
;;    For fuzzy completion (choice `fuzzy' when cycling with `C-('),
;;    `TAB' completes non-filename input using fuzzy prefix matching
;;    as defined in library `fuzzy-match.el'.  See the Commentary in
;;    `fuzzy-match.el' for details about fuzzy matching.
;;
;;    Fuzzy completion is not available for file-name completion; it
;;    is always case-sensitive; leading spaces are taken into account;
;;    and completion candidates are always sorted by decreasing fuzzy
;;    match strength.  In other words, fuzzy completion is not
;;    affected by `C-A', `M-_', or `C-,'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-levenshtein-distance' is the Levenshtein
;;    distance allowed for strings to be considered as matching during
;;    N-off completion.  This means that two strings match if they
;;    differ by at most this many character operations (insertion,
;;    deletion, replacement).  This option is used only if you have
;;    library `levenshtein.el'.  See (@> "Fuzzy Completion").
;;
;;  * Top-level command `icicle-search' uses several faces to
;;    highlight found text that matches your input.  Faces
;;    `icicle-search-main-regexp-current' and
;;    `icicle-search-main-regexp-others' highlight what your
;;    search-context regexp (entered with `RET') matches.  The former
;;    highlights the current search context; the latter highlights all
;;    other search contexts.
;;
;;    Face `icicle-search-current-input' highlights what your current
;;    input (typically another regexp) matches; that is, it highlights
;;    a match within a search context.  Faces
;;    `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;    `icicle-search-context-level-8' highlight the first eight regexp
;;    subgroup matches, within a search context.  This highlighting is
;;    done whenever `icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag' is
;;    non-nil and the search context corresponds to the entire regexp.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag'
;;    controls highlighting of regexp subgroup matches within the
;;    search context.  Non-nil (the default value) means highlight
;;    them.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' controls
;;    highlighting with face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others': this
;;    many matches, maximum, are highlighted.  If zero, then only the
;;    current match is highlighted.  The effect is similar to the
;;    Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting of Isearch (except that the
;;    highlighting is not in fact lazy).
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    means highlight the current input match in all main search hits
;;    at the same time.  If `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag'
;;    is also non-nil, then what is highlighted for each input match
;;    is the expanded common match among all input matches throughout
;;    the search area.  If either is nil, then only the exact input
;;    match is highlighted.
;;
;;    The default value of `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    is nil, because non-nil can impact performance negatively if
;;    there are many search contexts - the highlighting is updated
;;    with each input change.  You can toggle the value at any time
;;    using command `icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to
;;    `C-^' in the minibuffer (except during file-name completion).
;;
;;  * If, in addition to `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    and `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-flag', option
;;    `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' is also non-nil, then
;;    a search replacement replaces the expanded common match;
;;    otherwise, it replaces only the exact match.  You can toggle the
;;    value at any time using `M-;' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-search' highlighting is removed after the search.  This
;;    is the default behavior.  If you set this to nil then you can
;;    remove search highlighting manually later using command
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-cleanup'.  You can toggle this search
;;    highlight removal at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', bound to `C-.' in the minibuffer
;;    (except during file-name completion).
;;
;;    One use of nil `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to highlight
;;    regexp matches throughout a region or buffer (or multiple files
;;    or...).  In that capacity, Icicles search functions act like
;;    some of the highlighting commands in my library `highlight.el'.
;;    Note that when `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is nil, *all*
;;    Icicles search highlighting remains: last-visited search
;;    context, other context matches, current-input matches, and even
;;    regexp subgroups.  The faces for these are, respectively:
;;
;;     - `icicle-search-main-regexp-current'
;;     - `icicle-search-main-regexp-others'
;;     - `icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here' (everywhere, if
;;       `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-nil)
;;     - `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;       `icicle-search-context-level-8'
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-search-whole-word-flag' means that
;;    whole-word search is done.  All characters in your search string
;;    are searched for literally, and matches for the string must
;;    begin and end on a word boundary.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-context-match-predicate', if non-nil,
;;    is a predicate that takes a search-context (string) argument.
;;    Only contexts that satisfy the predicate are used.  For example,
;;    if the predicate is (lambda (x) (commandp (intern-soft x))),
;;    then only contexts that name commands are kept.
;;
;;  * If user option `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is
;;    nil, then whatever matches your current input is replaced,
;;    within the current search context, when you perform replacement
;;    during Icicles searching (e.g. `C-S-RET').  If the value is
;;    non-nil (the default value), then the entire search context is
;;    replaced, instead.  You can use `C-,' at any time during
;;    searching and replacing, to toggle the value.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-replace-literally-flag' determines
;;    whether Icicles search-and-replace replaces text literally or
;;    interprets `\' specially in the replacement text, as in
;;    `query-replace-regexp'.  Non-nil means to treat replacement text
;;    literally.  The default value is nil.  You can use `C-M-`' to
;;    toggle this at any time during Icicles search.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-hook' is a list of functions to be
;;    run after searching and moving to an `icicle-search' match,
;;    whether you move there by `RET', `C-RET', `C-next', or
;;    `C-prior'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-bookmark-name-length-max' is the maximum
;;    number of characters to use when `icicle-bookmark-cmd' (`C-x r
;;    m') with a non-negative numeric prefix argument automatically
;;    names a bookmark.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag' determines
;;    whether commands such as `icicle-bookmark' and
;;    `icicle-search-bookmark' refresh the bookmark-list cache.  The
;;    default value of t, meaning refresh, ensures that the set of
;;    bookmark candidates is always up-to-date, but you can improve
;;    performance for a large bookmark list if you customize it to
;;    nil.
;;
;;    In any case, a plain prefix argument (`C-u') for these commands
;;    overrides the default setting of the option for the duration of
;;    the command.  Thus if the customized value is nil, you can use
;;    `C-u' occasionally to refresh the list on demand.  In addition,
;;    the cache is refreshed whenever you use `S-delete' to delete a
;;    candidate bookmark.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' means
;;    that for some commands additional information is shown along
;;    with each completion candidate.  That is, a multi-completion is
;;    used.  You can match against any parts of the multi-completion.
;;    The default value is t.
;;
;;    For example, for command `icicle-search', the name of the buffer
;;    associated with each completion candidate is added to the
;;    candidate and highlighted.  You can match against the buffer
;;    name, as well as the search hit within the buffer.
;;
;;    Note that even when the value of this option is nil, you can
;;    often see the multi-completion information in the mode-line when
;;    you cycle candidates, and you can typically see it in the help
;;    that is displayed by `C-M-mouse-2' and so on.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-buffer-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp', `icicle-buffer-predicate', and
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras' determine the behavior of Icicles buffer
;;    commands, such as `icicle-buffer' and `insert-buffer'.  They
;;    determine the set of buffer-name candidates initially available
;;    for completion.
;;
;;    The first three restrict this set to names that satisfy the
;;    properties they specify.  Option `icicle-buffer-extras' lets you
;;    add additional buffer names to the set of candidates, after
;;    restriction by the other options.  Extra buffer-name candidates
;;    are displayed in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;    `icicle-extra-candidate'.
;;
;;    Note that if an extra candidate is already a candidate anyway
;;    then it will be present twice in the list of all candidates
;;    (that is, unless `icicle-transform-function' removes duplicate
;;    candidates).
;;
;;    Since these are user options, they provide an additional, more
;;    static way to filter the set of candidates.  Typing input
;;    (e.g. a regexp) then dynamically filters the result of applying
;;    the filter options.
;;
;;    Options `icicle-file-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-file-no-match-regexp', `icicle-file-predicate', and
;;    `icicle-file-extras' act similarly for file-name completion.
;;    You could use `icicle-file-no-match-regexp' or
;;    `icicle-file-predicate', for instance, to exclude files that are
;;    in or under the directories in `vc-directory-exclusion-list':
;;
;;    (defun my-locate-non-vc-file ()
;;      "`icicle-locate-file', but excluding stuff in VC directories."
;;      (interactive)
;;      (let ((icicle-file-predicate  'not-excluded-vc-file-p))
;;        (icicle-locate-file)))
;;
;;    (defun not-excluded-vc-file-p (file)
;;      "nil if FILE is in a `vc-directory-exclusion-list' directory."
;;      (or (not (boundp 'vc-directory-exclusion-list))
;;          (not (consp vc-directory-exclusion-list))
;;          (not (let ((case-fold-search  completion-ignore-case))
;;                 (catch 'nevfp
;;                   (dolist (dir  vc-directory-exclusion-list)
;;                     (when (string-match
;;                            (concat ".*" dir "\\(/.*\\)?")
;;                            file)
;;                       (throw 'nevfp t)))
;;                   nil)))))
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-ignored-directories' is a list of directories
;;    that are ignored by commands `icicle-locate-file' and
;;    `icicle-locate-file-no-symlinks'.  By default, this is the value
;;    of `vc-directory-exclusion-list'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-sort' is a predicate used to sort
;;    buffer-name candidates in Icicles buffer commands, such as
;;    `icicle-buffer' and `icicle-insert-buffer'.  One possible value
;;    is `icicle-buffer-sort-*...*-last', which sorts names of
;;    internal buffers, which begin with `*', after other buffer
;;    names.  Option `icicle-file-sort' acts similarly for file-name
;;    completion.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-configs' is a list of named
;;    configurations of options `icicle-buffer-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp', `icicle-buffer-predicate',
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras', and `icicle-buffer-sort'.  You use
;;    command `icicle-buffer-config' to choose one of the
;;    configurations to be current.  You can use commands
;;    `icicle-add-buffer-config' and `icicle-remove-buffer-config' to
;;    add and remove configurations from the list.
;;
;;    Example: A configuration such as the following, named "Files and
;;    Scratch", defines `icicle-buffer-predicate' to display only file
;;    buffers, and it defines `icicle-buffer-extras' to include the
;;    extra buffer `*scratch*':
;;
;;     ("Files and Scratch" nil nil
;;      (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))
;;      ("*scratch*") icicle-sort-comparer)
;;
;;    The idea of buffer-option configurations was borrowed from
;;    library `bs.el', by Olaf Sylvester <olaf@geekware.de>.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-dot-string' is the regexp string inserted by
;;    `icicle-insert-dot-command' (bound to `.' in the minibuffer
;;    during completion).  You can set it to a regexp that matches any
;;    character, including newline.  The default value instead matches
;;    any character except newline.  You can toggle between these two
;;    behaviors using command `icicle-toggle-dot', bound to `C-M-.'
;;    during completion.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-dot-show-regexp-flag' means show the
;;    underlying regexp (value of constant `icicle-anychar-regexp')
;;    explicitly for a multi-line dot (`.').  A nil value works only
;;    for Emacs versions 21 and later.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-list-join-string',
;;    `icicle-list-end-string', and
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' are described in sections
;;    (@> "Multi-Completions") and
;;    (@> "Programming Multi-Completions").  Option
;;    `icicle-list-join-string' is the separator string that joins
;;    together the parts of a multi-completion.  The end string is
;;    appended to each multi-completion candidate.  Option
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' specifies how the
;;    multi-completion extracted parts are joined back together when a
;;    user chooses a multi-completion.
;;
;;    The default value of `icicle-list-join-string' is `^G^J'.  With
;;    Emacs 22 and later, the `^G' part is hidden when it appears in
;;    *Completions*, and you can hide it in the minibuffer also by
;;    using `C-M-j' instead of typing `C-q C-g C-j'.  See the doc
;;    string for more information.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-candidate-part' highlights one or more parts of a
;;    candidate, in buffer `*Completions*'.  The candidate is
;;    typically a multi-completion.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-special-candidate' highlights candidates, in
;;    `*Completions*', that are considered "special".  Generally,
;;    these are candidates that match user option
;;    `icicle-special-candidate-regexp'.
;;
;;  * Similarly, face `icicle-proxy-candidate' highlights proxy
;;    candidates.  These are placeholders for real candidates.
;;    Non-nil user option `icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' means
;;    include proxy candidates whenever there are any.  You can toggle
;;    this option during completion using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-proxy-candidates', which is bound to `C-M-_' in
;;    the minibuffer.  For performance reasons, you will in some cases
;;    need to re-invoke the command to make the proxy candidates
;;    available.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-extra-candidate' highlights extra candidates, that
;;    is, members of `icicle-extra-candidates', `icicle-buffer-extras',
;;    or `icicle-file-extras'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-kmacro-ring-max' acts as `kmacro-ring-max'
;;    when you are in Icicle mode.  (When you exit Icicle mode,
;;    `kmacro-ring-max' is restored.)  In Icicles, you will typically
;;    want to use a much larger number than the default value in
;;    vanilla Emacs.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `icicle-search-ring-max' act as `regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `search-ring-max', respectively, when you are in Icicle mode.
;;    (When you exit Icicle mode, `regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `search-ring-max' are restored.)  The reason for having these
;;    options is that with Icicles you will likely want to use a much
;;    longer search history.  By default, these are as large as
;;    possible (virtually unlimited).
;;
;;    Suggestion: If you use library `savehist.el' (recommended),
;;    customize `savehist-additional-variables' to include variables
;;    `search-ring' and `regexp-search-ring', so that your search
;;    histories will be saved between Emacs sessions.
;;
;;    Note: You can clear (empty) a given search history with command
;;    `clear-option' (aka `icicle-reset-option-to-nil').  For example,
;;    to clear the regular-expression search history, do this:
;;
;;      `C-u M-x clear-option RET regexp-search-ring RET'
;;
;;    (The `C-u' is needed because this variable is not a user
;;    option.)  If you use my library `misc-cmds.el', you can clear
;;    search histories easier, using commands `clear-search-history',
;;    `clear-regexp-search-history', and `clear-search-histories'.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Isearch Completion").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-completion-history-max-length' limits the
;;    number of completion inputs to save.  If you customize user
;;    option `icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag' to non-nil, then,
;;    instead of cycling, `C-l' lets you use Icicles completion to
;;    retrieve a past completion input.  (`C-L' does the same thing.)
;;    If you use library `savehist.el', then you can save the history
;;    of completion inputs persistently by customizing user option
;;    `savehist-additional-variables' to include the Icicles internal
;;    variables `icicle-previous-raw-file-name-inputs' and
;;    `icicle-previous-raw-non-file-name-inputs'.
;;
;;  * Faces `icicle-completion', `icicle-multi-command-completion',
;;    and `icicle-mustmatch-completion' indicate the status of
;;    minibuffer completion.  During completion, Icicles uses them for
;;    a minibuffer indicator and, if user option
;;    `icicle-highlight-lighter-flag' is non-nil, for the `Icy'
;;    mode-line lighter as well.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-highlight-input-initial-whitespace-flag'
;;    uses face `icicle-whitespace-highlight' to highlight any
;;    whitespace that starts your minibuffer input.  This is done to
;;    help you recognize accidentally typing such whitespace.
;;    Otherwise, you might not understand the set of matching
;;    completion candidates (or lack thereof).  There is not
;;    necessarily anything wrong with input that starts with
;;    whitespace - it might be what you want, but without this
;;    highlighting it is easy to not notice the whitespace.
;;
;;  * The part of your current input that does not complete can be
;;    highlighted automatically, and you can then remove that part
;;    using `C-M-l'.  This highlighting is controlled by options
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-flag',
;;    `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag',
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure',
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay', and
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold'.  The
;;    highlighting uses face `icicle-input-completion-fail' (for
;;    strict completion) or `icicle-input-completion-fail-lax' (for
;;    lax completion).  For details, see the option doc strings and
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icicles Highlights the Input that Won't Complete").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' specifies top-level
;;    commands and their bindings for Icicle mode.  By default, this
;;    rebinds several standard Emacs keys (in Icicle mode only).  For
;;    example, it substitutes `icicle-kill-buffer' for `kill-buffer'
;;    (binding it to whatever `kill-buffer' is bound to globally).
;;    Top-level commands are commands that are not used only in the
;;    minibuffer.  To change these bindings, customize
;;    `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  If you do that, then you must
;;    exit and re-enter Icicle mode to ensure that the change takes
;;    effect.  This is really necessary only if your changes would
;;    undefine a key.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' defines a few
;;    top-level Icicles commands whose names do not begin with
;;    `icicle-', for convenience when using `M-x'.  For example,
;;    command `toggle' is defined as an alias for command
;;    `icicle-toggle-option'.  In any case, no such command is ever
;;    defined by Icicles if a function with the same name is already
;;    defined.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-color-themes' is a list of color themes to
;;    cycle through when you use command `icicle-color-theme'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-saved-completion-sets' is a persistent list
;;    of named sets of completion candidates.  You can switch among
;;    such sets at any time.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-filesets-as-saved-completion-sets-flag'
;;    non-nil means you can use Emacs filesets to save completion
;;    candidates persistently.  This means that you can save file-name
;;    candidates in a persistent Icicles saved completion set (cache
;;    file) or in in an Emacs fileset.  It also means that an Icicles
;;    persistent completion set can contain filesets, in addition to
;;    file names: any number of filesets, and filesets of different
;;    type.  Available only for Emacs 22 and later, and you must load
;;    library `filesets.el' (and enable filesets using
;;    `(filesets-init)').
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-key-descriptions-use-<>-flag' determines
;;    whether angle brackets (`<', `>') are used by Icicles for named
;;    keys, such as function keys (`<f9>' vs `f9') and pseudo keys
;;    (`<mode-line>' vs `mode-line').  Non-nil means to use angle
;;    brackets.  This option does not affect Emacs key descriptions
;;    outside of Icicles (e.g. `C-h k' or `C-h w'), and it has no
;;    effect for versions of Emacs prior to 21, because they never use
;;    angle brackets.  The default value is nil, because I think angle
;;    brackets reduce readability.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion' is a list of
;;    variables that are bound to keymaps in which you want to bind
;;    `S-TAB' (actually, each of the keys in the value of option
;;    `icicle-key-complete-keys') to `icicle-complete-keys'.  Each
;;    such keymap should have at least one prefix key.  `S-TAB' is
;;    bound in each keymap, so that you can use it to complete the
;;    prefix keys.  See also `icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag'.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag' means bind
;;    `S-TAB' (actually, each of the keys in the value of option
;;    `icicle-key-complete-keys') to `icicle-complete-keys' in each
;;    keymap of option `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion', regardless
;;    of whether `S-TAB' already has a binding in that keymap.  A
;;    value of nil means bind `S-TAB' only if there is not already a
;;    binding.
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-flag' means
;;    that `icicle-complete-keys' includes self-inserting keys as
;;    completion candidates.  You will probably want to leave this nil
;;    and use command `icicle-insert-char', not
;;    `icicle-complete-keys', to insert special characters.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-yank-function' is a function to use to yank
;;    text.  By default, it is `yank'.  Command
;;    `icicle-yank-maybe-completing' calls this function, except when
;;    it is called from the minibuffer or called with a negative
;;    prefix argument.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-use-candidates-only-once-flag' means
;;    that acting on a candidate removes it from the set of available
;;    candidates, so that you don't see that it can be used again.
;;    (`TAB' or `S-TAB' makes it available again.)  The default value
;;    is nil, and you probably do not want to customize this.
;;    However, if you write Emacs-Lisp code that uses completion, then
;;    you can bind this to non-nil in contexts where that makes sense.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-deletion-action-flag' means
;;    `S-delete' during completion deletes the current object.  More
;;    precisely, it deletes the object named by the current completion
;;    candidate, if a deletion action is defined for the current
;;    command.  If no deletion action is defined, then the value of
;;    this option has no effect for that command.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-alternative-actions-alist' is an alist that
;;    associates Emacs commands and alternative action functions.  It
;;    overrides any alternative actions defined otherwise for the
;;    commands.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-type-actions-alist' is an alist that
;;    associates Emacs object types, such as buffer, file, and
;;    process, with functions that accept an object of the given type
;;    as their only required object.  This is used by some Emacs
;;    commands during completion to prompt for a function to apply to
;;    the current completion candidate.  Each function can be a symbol
;;    or a lambda expression.  At runtime, symbols that are not
;;    functions (`functionp') are ignored.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-type-actions-alist' is an alist of Emacs
;;    object types and associated actions (functions).  Each function
;;    must accept an object of the specified type as its only required
;;    argument.  A function here can be a symbol or a lambda
;;    expression.  Any symbols that do not have function definitions
;;    when this option is used are filtered out (not used).
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-use-anything-candidates-flag' means
;;    Anything actions are used for candidate alternate actions in
;;    some Icicles commands, and Anything types and actions are used
;;    by command `icicle-object-action' (aka `what-which-how' and
;;    `a').  The default value is t.  This option has no effect if
;;    library `anything.el' cannot be loaded.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag'
;;    means that Anything function `anything-transform-candidates' is
;;    applied to displayed Anything candidates in Icicles.
;;
;;    The advantage of a nil value is that command `icicle-anything'
;;    then acts as a multi-command: you can act on multiple
;;    candidates, or apply multiple actions for the same candidate,
;;    within a single invocation of `icicle-anything' (or related
;;    commands).  The advantage of a non-nil value is that some of the
;;    displayed Anything candidates might be more readable.  The
;;    default value is nil.  This option has no effect if library
;;    `anything.el' cannot be loaded.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' controls how face
;;    and color names are displayed as candidates in `*Completions*'.
;;    If value is non-nil, then a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
;;    get) sample of the face or color is shown.  If the value is a
;;    string, then a face name is accompanied by a separate face
;;    swatch with that string text.  If the value is t, then the face
;;    name itself is shown using the face it names.  You can use
;;    command `icicle-toggle-WYSIWYG-Completions' to toggle this
;;    option.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag'
;;    means that `completing-read' and (starting with Emacs 23)
;;    `read-file-name' will strip all text properties from the result
;;    they return.  Regardless of the option value, Icicles strips
;;    text properties that it adds for its internal use.  See the doc
;;    string of function `icicle-unpropertize' for more information
;;    about this.
;;
;;    The default value of the option is nil.  It is not likely that
;;    you will need to change this, but you might if you use some
;;    other library that cannot accept a propertized string as the
;;    result of completion.
;;
;;    Note: This is the case if you use GNUS - it has a known bug in
;;    this regard (reported 2008-06-21).  It blindly prints the
;;    Emacs-Lisp string that is the result of completion into an MML
;;    attribute value: filename=#("~/.gnus/attach.el" 0 25 (face
;;    nil)).  GNUS should ensure that whatever it uses for an
;;    attribute value is valid for MML (has normal "..." string
;;    syntax, with acceptable characters).  But it simply calls a Lisp
;;    print function, which prints #("...").
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-pp-eval-expression-print-length' and
;;    `icicle-pp-eval-expression-print-level' control the Lisp sexp
;;    print length and print level, respectively, for values printed
;;    by `M-:' (`icicle-pp-eval-expression').
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' means that all
;;    executable files (or all files, if option
;;    `shell-completion-execonly' is nil) in your search path are
;;    included among the completion candidates whenever a
;;    shell command is read.  The particular non-nil value determines
;;    when this list of commands is updated from your current search
;;    path.  The default value is nil.
;;    See (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements").
;;
;;  * Non-nil option `icicle-quote-shell-file-name-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-read-shell-command-completing' double-quotes the file
;;    name at the beginning of the shell command it reads.  This
;;    affects several Emacs commands, such as `M-!' that read a shell
;;    command and its arguments.
;;
;;    If this is nil, then such commands will not quote a
;;    shell-command file name such as
;;    `c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe'.  In that case, a shell such
;;    as `bash' fails for a shell command such as
;;    `c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe arg1 arg2 &', because it
;;    interprets only `c:/Program' as the shell command.  That is, it
;;    interprets the space (`SPC') characters in the file name as
;;    separators.
;;
;;    If this is non-nil (the default value), then input such as
;;    `c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe arg1 arg2 &' is passed to the
;;    shell as `"c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe" arg1 arg2 &'
;;    (notice the double-quotes).
;;
;;    See the doc string of `icicle-quote-file-name-part-of-cmd' for
;;    information about the characters that, like `SPC', lead to
;;    file-name quoting.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-inhibit-ding-flag' means Icicles
;;    never uses an audible bell (ding).
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-option-type-prefix-arg-list' is a list of symbols
;;    that control prefix arguments for command
;;    `icicle-describe-option-of-type (bound to `C-h C-o' by
;;    default). A list of six symbols taken from this list:
;;
;;    `direct'            `inherit'            `inherit-or-value'
;;    `direct-or-value'   `inherit-or-regexp'  `direct-or-regexp'
;;
;;    Choose the order you like. The list members map, in order from
;;    left to right, to these prefix argument keys:
;;
;;      1. `C-u C-u'
;;      2. `C-0'
;;      3. `C-u'
;;      4. `C-9' (positive)
;;      5. no prefix arg
;;      6. `C--' (negative)
;;
;;    For the meanings of the symbols, see the doc string of
;;    `icicle-describe-option-of-type', which describes the default
;;    prefix-argument bindings for the command.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option `icicle-customize-save-flag' means that
;;    Icicles will save the updated value of option
;;    `icicle-command-abbrev-alist' when you quit Emacs.  This is the
;;    normal behavior.  If you for some reason do not want your
;;    `custom-file' or init file updated in this way, then customize
;;    `icicle-customize-save-flag' to nil.
;;
;;  * If `icicle-buffers-ido-like-flag' is t then `icicle-buffer' and
;;    similar commands act more Ido-like.  Specifically, those
;;    commands then bind these options to t:
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag',
;;    `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag', and
;;    `icicle-default-value'.
;;
;;  * If `icicle-files-ido-like-flag' is t then `icicle-file' and
;;    similar commands act more Ido-like.  Specifically, those
;;    commands then bind these options to t:
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag',
;;    `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag', and
;;    `icicle-default-value'.
;;
;;  * The value of option `icicle-customize-save-variable-function' is
;;    the function Icicles uses to automatically save user option
;;    changes made by some commands.  I recommend that you do *NOT*
;;    change this option value.  This is provided only for users who
;;    might want to disable such automatic saving of option changes,
;;    by setting this to `ignore', or users who might want to manage
;;    such option saving using their own function instead of the
;;    default value, `customize-save-variable'.

;;
;;  File-Name and Directory-Name Completion Tips
;;  --------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section contains some tips about completing file and
;;  directory names.
;;
;;  * Functions `icicle-dirs-first-p' and `icicle-dirs-last-p' are
;;    provided as possible values for user option
;;    `icicle-sort-comparer'.  They treat file and directory names
;;    specially, sorting directory names before or after file names;
;;    otherwise, they are the same as `icicle-case-string-less-p'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag' controls whether or
;;    not minibuffer-input cycling explores subdirectories.  By
;;    default, it is nil, meaning that cycling does not descend into
;;    subdirectories.
;;
;;    non-nil - When this option is non-nil, you might want to use a
;;          function such as `icicle-dirs-last-p' for option
;;          `icicle-sort-comparer', to prevent cycling depth-first
;;          into the subdirectories.
;;
;;    nil - When this option is nil, you can still choose to cycle
;;          into a given directory (which is why nil is the default
;;          value).  When cycling reaches a candidate directory that
;;          you want to cycle through, just: 1) move the cursor
;;          (e.g. `C-e'), 2) hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to "complete" the
;;          candidate, and then 3) use any of the cycle keys, such as
;;          `up', to cycle within the candidate directory.
;;
;;          Although the candidate directory was already completed by
;;          cycling, moving the cursor and explicitly "completing" it
;;          tells Icicles that you want to treat the candidate in the
;;          minibuffer as real input, just as if you had typed it, not
;;          merely as a cycling candidate.
;;
;;  * You can use `..' during completion to access a parent directory,
;;    and you can use `/' and `~/' to shadow input to the left.  There
;;    is currently no special treatment of MS Windows drive letters
;;    (e.g. `C:') - I use Cygwin on Windows.
;;
;;  * Non-nil user option
;;    `icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag' hides the common
;;    match for your current input from each candidate in
;;    *Completions*.  You can toggle this at any time during
;;    completion using `C-x .' (`icicle-toggle-hiding-common-match').
;;    This can be especially useful when reading an absolute file name
;;    (e.g. `C-u C-x C-f'), by removing any common directory
;;    component.
;;
;;  * Standard Emacs user option `completion-ignored-extensions' is a
;;    list of file-name extensions.  File names that match any of
;;    these extensions are generally ignored for completion (but see
;;    the doc string for particulars).  In Icicles, however, the
;;    behavior is slightly different:
;;
;;    - In vanilla Emacs the option is itself ignored for display in
;;      buffer `*Completions*'.  That is, even file names that are
;;      ignored for completion are shown in `*Completions*' as
;;      available completion candidates.
;;
;;    - In Icicles this is not the case. When a file name is ignored
;;      it is ignored completely; it is not shown in `*Completions*'.
;;      But in Icicles you can toggle this ignoring off or on at any
;;      time during completion, using `C-.' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    In addition, if you load library `completion-ignored-build.el',
;;    by Kevin Ryde, then Icicles automatically takes advantage of
;;    that library's dynamic adjustment of ignored extensions.  (Just
;;    load the library - do not enable its minor mode or advice.)
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-use-~-for-home-dir-flag' controls whether
;;    your home directory is written in the minibuffer using `~' or in
;;    expanded form, during completion.  The default value is `t',
;;    which means to use `~', saving minibuffer space.  You can toggle
;;    this option at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-~-for-home-dir', bound to `M-~'.
;;
;;  * Remember that you can use a regular expression to
;;    apropos-complete file names.  This is a powerful feature.  Do
;;    not confuse its use with the ability to use shell wildcards
;;    (globbing) to access multiple files at once.  For example, if
;;    you use `C-x 4 f *.el RET', then all files with suffix `el' will
;;    be opened.  Regexp matching is used only for apropos (not
;;    prefix) completion and cycling.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "What About Special-Character Conflicts?").
;;
;;  * You can use `$' for both environment variables and as a regexp
;;    special character.  For example, you can use a pattern such as
;;    `$HOME.*t$' to match the files in your home directory (`$HOME')
;;    whose names end in `t'.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "What About Special-Character Conflicts?").
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23, and if the current `TAB' completion
;;    method is `vanilla' (see (@* "Fuzzy Completion")), you can
;;    complete environment variables during file-name completion,
;;    using `TAB'.  So you can, for example, complete `$HO' to any of
;;    the candidates `HOME', `HOMEDRIVE', `HOMEPATH'.  This is in
;;    addition to the expansion of complete environment variables
;;    (e.g. `$HOME' to `/my/home/dir/') when you use `S-TAB' or `RET'.
;;
;;  * You can use the idiom `\W$' as input to match only directories,
;;    when a command asks for a file or directory name.  The `\W' says
;;    to match any non word-syntax character.  The `$' says to match
;;    this at the end of the name.  This works because directory names
;;    appear as completion candidates with a trailing slash (`/'), and
;;    slash (`/') is about the only non word-syntax character that is
;;    likely to appear in file-name completions.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "What About Special-Character Conflicts?").
;;
;;  * You can use library `ffap.el', if you like, with Icicles, to
;;    pick up the file, directory, or URL name under the cursor.  All
;;    Icicles features are available during file-name and URL
;;    completion.  If you like `ffap.el', you might also like to try
;;    my extension library `ffap-.el'.   See also
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor").
;;
;;  * Many Icicles commands that target file or directory names look
;;    only in the current directory (`default-directory').  This means
;;    that the directory part of the name is ignored for matching
;;    purposes.  You can thus use apropos completion to match a
;;    substring, without needing to prefix the substring with `.*'.
;;    For example, to match file `favorite-foo-file.bar' in directory
;;    `/some/path/to/my/', it is sufficient to use either `foo' or
;;    `/some/path/to/my/foo'.
;;
;;  * Some Icicles commands that target file names match your input
;;    against file names as ordinary strings, that is, with no notion
;;    that they are actually file names.  This is the case for
;;    `icicle-locate-file', `icicle-recent-file',
;;    `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table', and
;;    `icicle-find-file-absolute', as well as `icicle-file' with a
;;    prefix argument.  Such candidates are often absolute file names.
;;    In that case, you can regexp-match against any part of the
;;    absolute file name, including directory components.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere").
;;
;;  * If you have symbolic links that might get in the way of
;;    exploring directories while locating files, you can use command
;;    `icicle-locate-file-no-symlinks' instead of
;;    icicle-ignored-directories' - it will not follow symbolic links.
;;
;;    This also gives you a way to temporarily avoid descending into a
;;    subdirectory you are not interested in: put a symbolic link in
;;    its place temporarily.
;;
;;    Another, cleaner way to skip certain directories is to customize
;;    or `let'-bind option `icicle-ignored-directories'. By default
;;    this is the value of `vc-directory-exclusion-list', which means
;;    that it ignores version-control directories.

;;
;;  Key Bindings
;;  ------------
;;
;;  You can customize any of the key bindings that Icicles uses - see
;;  (@> "Customizing Key Bindings").  I recommend that you first try
;;  using the default bindings, however.  There are many Icicles key
;;  bindings (in particular in the minibuffer), but they are grouped
;;  into a few natural sets, to help you remember them.
;;
;;(@* "Global Bindings")
;;  ** Global Bindings **
;;
;;  Icicles does not change your global key bindings.  It changes some
;;  minibuffer bindings, and it adds some bindings for Icicle mode,
;;  but it does not change your global bindings.
;;
;;  There are two exceptions:
;;
;;  1. In Icicle mode, various Icicles commands are added to menu-bar
;;  menus.  File commands are added to the File menu, and so on, under
;;  an Icicles submenu.  Those items that do not belong naturally to
;;  any existing menu-bar menu are added to a new top-level Icicles
;;  menu and to the existing Minibuf menu.  Whatever the menu they
;;  appear in, however, Icicles menu items are visible only when
;;  Icicle mode is active.
;;
;;  If you do not want Icicles to add items to menus besides Minibuf
;;  and Icicles, then set option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus' to
;;  non-nil.  See (@> "Customizing Key Bindings").
;;
;;  2. Icicles adds the key `S-TAB' (bound to `icicle-complete-keys')
;;  to each existing keymap.  This allows you to complete keys in any
;;  keymap.  For technical reasons, these bindings are not part of
;;  `icicle-mode-map'; other keymaps are enhanced to include this
;;  binding.  However, this Icicles binding of `S-TAB' never replaces
;;  any existing binding of `S-TAB'.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Key Completion") for more
;;  information about this use of `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  (The documentation always refers to the key that performs key
;;  completion as `S-TAB'.  Actually, it is `S-TAB' only by default.
;;  You can customize it, using option `icicle-key-complete-keys'.)
;;
;;(@* "Icicle-Mode Bindings")
;;  ** Icicle-Mode Bindings **
;;
;;  Most Icicle-mode bindings are in the Icicles menu-bar menu.  In
;;  addition, option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' causes Icicles to
;;  bind some keyboard keys to some top-level Icicles commands.  Some
;;  of these take the place of similar, global bindings whenever you
;;  are in Icicle mode.  Typically, these top-level commands are
;;  Icicles multi-command versions of the vanilla Emacs commands.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands").
;;
;;  You can customize option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' to
;;  specify the top-level commands that you want to bind in Icicle
;;  mode, and the keys you want to bind them to.  With the default
;;  value of `icicle-top-level-key-bindings', Icicles makes the
;;  following Icicle-mode bindings:
;;
;;  * `C-c ''          - `icicle-occur'
;;  * `C-c ='          - `icicle-imenu'
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-search'
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-compilation-search' (in *grep* etc.)
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-comint-search' (in *shell* etc.)
;;  * `C-c TAB'        - `icicle-comint-command' (in *shell* etc.)
;;  * `C-c /'          - `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry'
;;  * `C-h C-o'        - `icicle-describe-option-of-type'
;;  * `ESC M-x'        - `lacarte-execute-command'
;;  * `M-`', `f10'     - `lacarte-execute-menu-command'
;;  * `M-x'            - `icicle-execute-extended-command'
;;  * `C-x SPC'        - `icicle-command-abbrev'
;;  * `C-x M-e'        - `icicle-execute-named-keyboard-macro'
;;  * `S-f4'           - `icicle-kmacro'
;;  * `pause'          - `icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer'
;;
;;  `S-TAB' is bound, in effect, to `icicle-complete-keys', which
;;  completes a key sequence.  Prefix keys followed by `S-TAB' are
;;  also bound to `icicle-complete-keys'.  (`S-TAB' is effectively
;;  bound to other commands in buffer `*Completions*' and in the
;;  minibuffer.)
;;
;;  (The documentation always refers to the key that performs key
;;  completion as `S-TAB'.  Actually, it is `S-TAB' only by default.
;;  You can customize it, using option `icicle-key-complete-keys'.)
;;
;;  When `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' has its default value,
;;  Icicles also substitutes all of the key bindings for some standard
;;  Emacs commands.  For example, Icicles binds `icicle-buffer' to all
;;  keys that are globally bound outside Icicle mode to standard
;;  command `switch-to-buffer'.  By default, the following standard
;;  commands have their bindings co-opted this way by Icicles
;;  commands:
;;

;;  `where-is'.........................`icicle-where-is'
;;  `yank'.............................`icicle-yank-maybe-completing'
;;
;;  Actually, by default, Icicles binds `icicle-yank-maybe-completing'
;;  to whatever the value of option `icicle-yank-function' is.  By
;;  default, this value is `yank'.
;;
;;  Option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' remaps not only these
;;  standard Emacs commands but also some commands provided by other
;;  libraries.  For example, if you use package Bookmark+, then
;;  type-specific bookmark jump commands such as
;;  `bmkp-dired-jump-other-window' are remapped to Icicles
;;  multi-command versions.
;;
;;  Here are some other Icicles commands that you might want to bind
;;  to keys in Icicle mode - they are not bound by Icicles (except to
;;  menu items):
;;
;;  `clear-option' (alias) - Set value of binary option to nil

;;(@* "Minibuffer Bindings")
;;  ** Minibuffer Bindings **
;;
;;  There are many key bindings available during completion.  Most of
;;  these key sequences are bound in the minibuffer completion
;;  keymaps, but some are bound in the `*Completions*' buffer keymap.
;;  In addition, clicking `C-mouse-3' on a completion candidate in
;;  buffer `*Completions*' pops up a menu of available commands.
;;
;;  Some of these menu commands are applicable to the completion you
;;  click; others apply to the current state of completion or to the
;;  complete set of completion candidates.  The associated key
;;  bindings are indicated in the menu items, so this can be a good
;;  way to learn minibuffer and `*Completions*' bindings.
;;
;;  The following key bindings are made for the minibuffer completion
;;  keymaps.  They are in effect whenever you are using the minibuffer
;;  for input with completion (e.g. `completing-read',
;;  `read-file-name', `M-x').
;;
;;    `C-?' - `icicle-minibuffer-help': Pop up a *Help* buffer with
;;            information on using the minibuffer in Icicle mode.
;;            During completion, this includes information similar to
;;            what you are reading now.  It also includes toggle
;;            commands and the current toggle values.
;;
;;    `down', `up'    - `icicle-next-prefix-candidate',
;;                      `icicle-next-candidate-per-mode' (modal),
;;                      `icicle-previous-prefix-candidate',
;;                      `icicle-previous-candidate-per-mode' (modal),
;;                      which cycle candidate prefix completions.
;;
;;    `next', `prior' - `icicle-next-apropos-candidate',
;;                      `icicle-previous-apropos-candidate', which
;;                      cycle candidate apropos completions.
;;
;;                      (The documentation always refers to the keys
;;                      that cycle completion candidates as `down',
;;                      `up', `next', and `prior'.  Actually, these
;;                      are the cycling keys only by default.  You can
;;                      customize the cycling keys, using options
;;                      `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys',
;;                      `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys' (modal),
;;                      `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys',
;;                      `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys' (modal),
;;                      `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys', and
;;                      `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys'.)
;;
;;    Keys bound globally to commands that perform simple text
;;    insertion, deletion, and transposition operations - commands
;;    such as `self-insert-command' - are bound to Icicles versions of
;;    those commands that do the same thing but also provide apropos
;;    icompletion.  This includes keys such as `C-d', `C-k', and `C-w'
;;    (and lots more).  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icompletion").
;;
;;    `pause'  - `icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer': Move cursor to
;;               the buffer from which the minibuffer was activated.
;;
;;    `C-insert' - `icicle-switch-to-Completions-buf': Move cursor to
;;               the current candidate in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;    `M-*'    - `icicle-narrow-candidates': Narrow the set of
;;               completion candidates using another input regexp.
;;
;;    `M-SPC'  - `icicle-prefix-word-complete': Complete current input
;;               in minibuffer, as a prefix, a single word at a time.
;;               This replaces `minibuffer-complete-word'.  In fact,
;;               it is the keys in `icicle-word-completion-keys' that
;;               are bound to this command; `M-SPC' is by default.
;;
;;    `S-SPC'  - `icicle-apropos-complete-and-narrow': Same as
;;               `S-TAB' followed by `M-*'.
;;
;;    `TAB' -    `icicle-prefix-complete': Complete current input in
;;               minibuffer, as a prefix.  If there is more than one
;;               prefix-completion candidate, display them in buffer
;;               `*Completions*', highlighting the common prefix.
;;               This replaces `minibuffer-complete'.
;;
;;               (The documentation always refers to the key that does
;;               this as `TAB'.  Actually, it is only `TAB' by
;;               default.  You can customize it, using option
;;               `icicle-prefix-complete-keys'.)
;;
;;    `S-TAB'  - In the minibuffer: `icicle-apropos-complete' - like
;;               `TAB', but use apropos completion.  In buffer
;;               `*Completions*': `icicle-move-to-previous-completion'
;;               - move backwards among candidates.
;;
;;               (The documentation always refers to the keys that do
;;               these things as `S-TAB'.  Actually, they are only
;;               `S-TAB' by default.  You can customize the keys,
;;               using options `icicle-apropos-complete-keys' and
;;               `icicle-previous-candidate-keys'.)
;;
;;    `C-M-TAB' - `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display': Like `TAB', but
;;               does not display candidates in `*Completions*'.
;;
;;               (The documentation always refers to the key that does
;;               this as `C-M-TAB'.  Actually, it is only `C-M-TAB' by
;;               default.  You can customize it, using option
;;               `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys'.)
;;
;;    `C-M-S-TAB' - `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display': Like
;;               `S-TAB', but does not display candidates.
;;
;;               (The documentation always refers to the key that does
;;               this as `C-M-S-TAB'.  Actually, it is only
;;               `C-M-S-TAB' by default.  You can customize it, using
;;               option `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys'.)
;;
;;    `C-M-&'  - `icicle-save-predicate-to-variable': Save the current
;;               predicate used for completion to a variable.
;;
;;    `delete' - `icicle-remove-candidate': Remove the current
;;               candidate from consideration.
;;
;;    `S-mouse-2' - `icicle-mouse-remove-candidate': Same as `delete'.
;;
;;    `M-q'    - `icicle-insert-key-description': Insert the textual
;;               representation of a key sequence, during key
;;               completion.
;;
;;    `M-o'    - `icicle-insert-history-element': Invoke completion to
;;               insert a previously entered input in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    `C-M-S-f' - `icicle-read+insert-file-name': Invoke completion to
;;               insert a file name in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    `C-M-S-c' - `icicle-completing-read+insert': Invoke completion
;;               to insert something other than a file name (not
;;               always available).
;;
;;               (`C-M-S-f' and `C-M-S-c' are the default values for
;;               the keys that invoke completion on demand.  You can
;;               customize the keys to use, using options
;;               `icicle-read+insert-file-name-keys' and
;;               `icicle-completing-read+insert-keys'.)
;;
;;  In Icicles, multi-line completion candidates are not uncommon.
;;  You can move up and down minibuffer lines with `C-p' and `C-n',
;;  and you can use the following keys to move among line beginnings
;;  and ends:
;;
;;    `C-a', `C-e' - `icicle-beginning-of-line+',
;;               `icicle-end-of-line+': Like normal `C-a', `C-e', but
;;               repeating goes to the previous or next line.
;;
;;  If you use libraries `fit-frame.el' and `oneonone.el' with a
;;  standalone minibuffer frame (non-nil
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag'), and if option
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil, then the minibuffer
;;  frame is automatically resized to fit its content as you edit that
;;  content.  (Options `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height' and
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height-percent' define the maximum
;;  height for this.)
;;
;;  If, in addition, you bind `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame' to a key,
;;  then you can use that key repeatedly to increase the height by one
;;  line, even beyond the maximum.  Library `setup-keys.el' binds this
;;  to `C-o'.
;;
;;  (If you do not use a separate minibuffer frame, then you will
;;  likely want to set standard option `resize-mini-windows' to t, not
;;  to `grow-only', at least while in Icicle mode.)
;;
;;    `C-M-j' - `icicle-insert-list-join-string': Insert
;;              `icicle-list-join-string'. See also
;;              (@> "Multi-Completions").
;;
;;  You can insert a single Icicles multi-line dot using `C-u .', or
;;  by turning on this dot magic generally, using `C-M-.':
;;
;;    `.'     - `icicle-insert-dot-command'
;;    `C-M-.' - `icicle-toggle-dot'
;;
;;  If option `icicle-cycling-respects-completion-mode' is non-nil,
;;  then you can use the keys that are defined by the following
;;  options for both prefix and apropos completion (as well as for
;;  input-history traversal):
;;
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-up-alt-action-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-down-alt-action-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-up-help-keys'
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-down-help-keys'
;;
;;  By default, the keys defined for these options are, respectively,
;;  `up', `down', `C-up', `C-down', `C-S-up', `C-S-down', `C-M-up',
;;  and `C-M-down'.  Whether one of the keys is used for prefix or
;;  apropos completion at a given time depends on the current
;;  completion mode, which is determined by which of `TAB' and `S-TAB'
;;  was used last.
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, the following keys have a special purpose during
;;  input completion, but in Icicles they simply insert the character
;;  typed - they are self-inserting.  This is because (1) there are
;;  better ways to do what vanilla Emacs uses these keys for and (2)
;;  it is useful to be able to insert these characters without first
;;  typing `C-q' to quote them.
;;
;;    `?'   - see also
;;            (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "What About Special-Character Conflicts?")
;;
;;    `SPC' (space)
;;
;;    `C-j' (newline) - see also `C-o', above, and
;;                      (@> "Multi-Completions")
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings are made to clear minibuffer
;;  input, making them handy for editing and removing completions
;;  (e.g. default or initial values) in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    `M-k' - `icicle-erase-minibuffer-or-history-element'
;;    `M-S-backspace', `M-S-delete' - `icicle-erase-minibuffer'
;;
;;  `M-k' has an alternative behavior when you are cycling minibuffer
;;  history items: it deletes the current item from the history.
;;
;;  During (absolute or relative) file-name completion, the following
;;  minibuffer bindings are also in effect:
;;
;;    `C-backspace'   - `icicle-up-directory':
;;                      Navigate up the directory hierarchy.
;;    `C-c +'         - `icicle-make-directory': Create a directory.
;;    `C-x m'         - `icicle-bookmark-file-other-window':
;;                      Visit a file or directory (Dired) bookmark.
;;                      See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Accessing Saved Locations (Bookmarks) on the Fly").
;;                      (Available only if you use `bookmark+.el'.)
;;
;;  During absolute file-name completion, you can use `C-c C-d' to
;;  change the current directory on the fly (think UNIX command `cd').
;;  See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Absolute File Names and Different Directories").
;;
;;  The following minibuffer binding moves the cursor to the start of
;;  the part of your input, if any, that is highlighted because it
;;  does not match any completion candidate (see option
;;  `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure').  Repeating this
;;  command kills the rest of the line, removing the highlighted
;;  mismatched input.
;;
;;    `C-M-l'         - `icicle-goto/kill-failed-input'
;;
;;  The remaining input matches at least one candidate.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings can be used to get rid of a
;;  completion inserted during cycling, and retrieve what you last
;;  typed during completion or any previous completion inputs:
;;
;;    `C-l'           - `icicle-retrieve-previous-input'
;;    `C-S-l' (`C-L') - `icicle-retrieve-next-input'
;;
;;  You can use these to cycle among and reuse inputs that you typed
;;  during completion but did not enter.  This completion input is not
;;  recorded in the standard input histories - they record only input
;;  that you have entered with `RET'.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  For example, suppose that you used `C-h v hook' to examine various
;;  hook variables, and you did this using`C-next' to display their
;;  documentation.  If you finished the command by just typing `C-g',
;;  then your input (`hook') was never really entered, so it is not
;;  available via the minibuffer history (`M-p').  You can retrieve it
;;  with `C-l', to use it again, in your next command.  User option
;;  `icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag' controls the behavior of `C-l'
;;  and `C-L'; if non-nil, then, instead of cycling inputs, these
;;  commands let you access previous inputs using completion.
;;
;;  You of course have the standard access to the minibuffer history,
;;  via `M-p', `M-n', `M-r', and `M-s'.  In addition to these, the
;;  following minibuffer bindings let you use apropos completion on
;;  the current minibuffer history list.  For explanation, see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;    `M-h'     - `icicle-history'
;;    `M-pause' - `icicle-keep-only-past-inputs'
;;
;;  Minibuffer binding `C-M-pause' lets you use a different minibuffer
;;  history during the current input reading with completion.
;;  Normally, you are prompted for the history to use.  Starting with
;;  Emacs 23, if option `icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag' is
;;  non-nil, then during command, abbrev, and keyboard-macro
;;  completion, `C-M-pause' completes your input against the history
;;  of all commands that were invoked interactively in any way,
;;  `icicle-interactive-history'.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings let you act on candidate
;;  completions.  For explanation, see

;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings let you incrementally change

;;  The following minibuffer binding lets you evaluate an Emacs-Lisp
;;  sexp at any time, using a recursive minibuffer.  It displays the

;;  result into the minibuffer at point.
;;
;;    `M-:'     - `icicle-pp-eval-expression-in-minibuffer'
;;
;;  Some additional bindings are made available in the minibuffer for
;;  the duration of specific commands:
;;
;;  * During completion of names of some kinds of objects (files,
;;    buffers, directories, Info nodes), `C-x m' lets you complete
;;    against bookmarks that have the same type as those objects (file
;;    bookmarks, buffer bookmarks, Dired bookmarks, Info bookmarks).
;;    This feature requires use of package Bookmark+.
;;
;;  * During completion of file names, `C-backspace' is bound to
;;    `icicle-up-directory', which navigates to the parent directory
;;    and completes there instead.
;;
;;  * During completion of bookmark names, various keys with the
;;    prefix `C-M-' are bound to commands that narrow the available
;;    candidates to bookmarks of a specific type.  For example,
;;    `C-M-d' narrows the choices to Dired bookmarks.
;;
;;  The following bindings are made for `completion-list-mode', that
;;  is, for buffer `*Completions*', which shows the list of candidate
;;  completions:
;;
;;    `left', `right' (`TAB')
;;                    - `icicle-move-to-previous-completion',
;;                      `icicle-move-to-next-completion': Navigate
;;                      backward & forward among candidates
;;    `up', `down'    - `icicle-previous-line', `icicle-next-line':
;;                      Navigate up & down among candidates (The
;;                      documentation refers to these keys as `up' and
;;                      `down'.  Actually, these are the keys only by
;;                      default.  You can customize them using options

;;                      `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'.)
;;    `C-insert'      - `icicle-insert-completion': Move cursor to the

;;
;;  Customizing Key Bindings
;;  ------------------------
;;
;;  See (@> "Key Bindings") for a description of the key bindings
;;  defined by Icicles.  The options mentioned here are also presented
;;  there, in context.  You can customize all of the key-binding user
;;  options with `M-x customize-group RET Icicles-Key-Bindings'.
;;
;;  Key bindings are very personal choices, and reflect preferences
;;  and habits, as well as keyboard and other configurations.  You
;;  might want to change some of the bindings that Icicles creates.
;;  This section tells you how to do that.
;;
;;  However, before doing so, unless the default bindings present a
;;  hardware or OS configuration problem for you, please try using the
;;  default bindings for a while, before deciding that you want to
;;  change them.  Habit is a powerful persuader, but its advice is not
;;  always the best ;-).
;;
;;  The main user option for customizing key bindings is
;;  `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  You use it to change or remove
;;  any of the top-level bindings in Icicle mode.
;;
;;  There are some other user options that make it easy to customize
;;  some Icicles key bindings.  Most of these are minibuffer key
;;  bindings.

;;  Minibuf and Icicles.  These items are placed in an Icicles submenu
;;  (e.g. Files > Icicles).  If you do not want to add an Icicles

;;
;;  There are user options for most Icicles minibuffer bindings that

;;
;;  To understand how you can modify Icicles minibuffer bindings, it

;;
;;  Suppose that you want to bind `f11' and `f12' to traverse the
;;  input history up and down whenever you are in Icicle mode.  There
;;  are no user options for this, but you can do it by inserting this
;;  code into your init file (~/.emacs), before the code that requires
;;  (loads) library `icicles.el':
;;
;;  (add-hook 'icicle-mode-hook 'bind-my-icicles-keys)
;;  (defun bind-my-icicles-keys ()

;;(@* "Programming with Fancy Candidates")
;;
;;  Programming with Fancy Candidates
;;  ---------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Icicles lets you program with several kinds of candidates that are
;;  not supported by vanilla Emacs.  For lack of a better word, I call
;;  them all "fancy candidates".  Multi-completions are fancy
;;  candidates.  So are ordinary string candidates that have text
;;  properties such as `face'.  And there are other kinds of fancy
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  Because they are not supported by vanilla Emacs, and because
;;  Icicles uses Emacs functions such as `all-completions' to perform
;;  the primitive completion operations, fancy candidates require some
;;  extra processing.
;;
;;  All fancy candidates must first be converted to a form that such
;;  primitives can understand.  During completion, fancy candidates
;;  must sometimes be displayed specially, for example using
;;  particular faces.  And after completion, the completion result
;;  must sometimes be converted back again to retrieve some or all of
;;  the original candidate information.
;;
;;  This conversion (encoding and decoding) can be costly, especially
;;  when there are many candidates.  For this reason, it is turned
;;  off, by default, so it that doesn't represent overhead during
;;  completion of non-fancy candidates.
;;
;;  In order to use `completing-read' with fancy candidates, you must
;;  do one of the following in your code:
;;
;;  1. Propertize at least the first character of the
;;     `completing-read' PROMPT argument string with a non-nil text
;;     property `icicle-fancy-candidates'.  This turns on processing
;;     of fancy candidates for the duration of the `completing-read'
;;     call.
;;
;;  2. Bind variable `icicle-fancy-candidates-p' to non-nil.
;;
;;  3. Bind variable `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to
;;     non-nil.
;;
;;  You use method 1 or 2 to handle multi-completion candidates or
;;  candidates that have text properties or are otherwise to be
;;  displayed specially.  I recommend that you generally use text
;;  property `icicle-fancy-candidates', not variable
;;  `icicle-fancy-candidates-p'.  The variable is provided so that you
;;  can widen the scope of this feature beyond a given call to
;;  `completing-read'.  You will need to do that only rarely.
;;
;;  A use case for variable `icicle-fancy-candidates-p' would be, for
;;  instance, if your code calls other code that calls
;;  `completing-read', so you have no direct access to the
;;  `completing-read' PROMPT argument in order to propertize it.  If
;;  you nevertheless want to use some fancy candidates, then you can
;;  bind `icicle-fancy-candidates-p' with the scope you want.
;;
;;  You use method 3, `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p', when
;;  you need to save and later retrieve all of the information
;;  contained in an alist COLLECTION entry.  Completion returns only a
;;  string.  If the COLLECTION alist has only one entry with a given
;;  string as its car, then you can simply use `assoc' to retrieve the
;;  whole entry.
;;
;;  But if you use an alist that allows entries with different cdrs
;;  for the same car, then you need some way to encode an entire alist
;;  entry in a display string.  When you have this need, set variable
;;  `icicle-candidates-alist' to the alist, and bind
;;  `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to non-nil.
;;
;;  This has the effect of encoding, as a text property on the
;;  candidate display string, the entire corresponding original alist
;;  entry.  You can then use `icicle-get-alist-candidate' to recover
;;  that information.
 
;;(@* "Programming Multi-Completions")
;;
;;  Programming Multi-Completions
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Multi-completions are completion candidates that are composed of
;;  parts separated by `icicle-list-join-string' and terminated by
;;  `icicle-list-end-string'.  See (@> "Multi-Completions") for
;;  information about how users interact with multi-completions.
;;
;;  Multi-completions are examples of fancy candidates.
;;  See (@> "Programming with Fancy Candidates").
;;
;;  You can define your own Icicles commands that use
;;  multi-completions.  You can bind `icicle-list-join-string' or
;;  `icicle-list-end-string' to any strings you like, depending on
;;  your needs.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Key Completion") for an
;;  example where `icicle-list-join-string' is bound to "  =  " and
;;  `icicle-list-end-string' is "".  This section describes two
;;  additional variables that you can bind to affect the appearance
;;  and behavior of multi-completions.
;;
;;(@* "Variable icicle-list-use-nth-parts")
;;  ** Variable icicle-list-use-nth-parts **
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' affects the minibuffer
;;  behavior of multi-completions.  If you bind this to a list of
;;  whole numbers, then multi-completion candidates are transformed
;;  using those numbers as indexes.  During completion and cycling,
;;  whenever a sole candidate matches the user input, if that
;;  candidate is a multi-completion, then it is transformed by
;;  extracting and possibly reordering its parts according to
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'.
;;
;;  The actual candidate to match is still the original candidate; the
;;  transformation takes place after matching, for final insertion in
;;  the minibuffer.  This means that you must use this feature only
;;  with lax (permissive) completion, since strict completion requires
;;  an exact match against the original completion candidate, and the
;;  transformed candidate will normally not match the original.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' works as follows.  The
;;  matching candidate is split at each `icicle-list-join-string' into
;;  its component parts.  The indexes in `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'
;;  are then used to extract parts, in the same order as the indexes
;;  appear.  The extracted parts are joined back together in an order
;;  that you specify, separated by the value of user option
;;  `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  An index greater than the
;;  number of parts means to use the last part.
;;
;;  For example: If the value of `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' is (1),
;;  then only the first part of the multi-completion is used as the
;;  completion candidate.  If the value is (2 1), then the resulting
;;  candidate is the second part followed by the first part, the two
;;  parts being joined by `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  If the
;;  value is (1 99) and the multi-completion has fewer than 99 parts,
;;  then the first and last parts are used.  If the value is (2 1 2),
;;  then the resulting candidate is composed of the second part
;;  followed by the first part followed by the second part again.
;;
;;  Thus, you can use a given part any number of times.  You can also
;;  mix multi-completions and single-string completions, and you can
;;  mix multi-completions composed of different numbers of strings.
;;  For example, a set of completions might be:
;;
;;  ((("cmd1" "description of cmd1"))
;;   (("cmd2" "description of cmd" "more"))
;;   (("cmd3")))
;;
;;  If you use multi-completions with `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' in
;;  your own commands, please make sure that their doc strings let
;;  users know what to expect, and remind them of the behavior of
;;  option `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  Let them know, in
;;  particular, that:
;;
;;  * They can match any part of a candidate as it is displayed in
;;    buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  * The candidate choice they make will in fact have the form that
;;    you define in your command.
;;
;;  * They can control how the parts are joined, using option
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.
;;
;;(@* "Variable icicle-candidate-properties-alist")
;;  ** Variable icicle-candidate-properties-alist **
;;
;;  Whereas variable `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' affects the
;;  appearance of multi-completions in the minibuffer, variable
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' affects their appearance in
;;  buffer `*Completions*'.  You use it to apply text properties to
;;  individual parts of a multi-completion, where the parts are
;;  defined in the same way as for `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'.
;;
;;  This feature affects all candidates the same way.  See also
;;  (@> "Candidates with Text Properties") for ways to apply text
;;  properties to individual candidates (which need not be
;;  multi-completions).
;;
;;  The value of `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' is an alist whose
;;  entries have either of these forms:
;;
;;  (NTH PROPERTIES) or (NTH PROPERTIES JOIN-TOO)
;;
;;  NTH is the number of the target multi-completion part.
;;
;;  PROPERTIES is a list of text properties to apply to the NTH part.
;;
;;  JOIN-TOO is optional.  If it is present and non-nil, then the text
;;  properties are also applied to the join string that follows the
;;  target part.
;;
;;  You can use any text properties, including `invisible', `keymap',
;;  `display', and properties that you define yourself and that have
;;  meaning to only your code.
;;
;;  As an example of its use, commands `icicle-fundoc',
;;  `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-doc', and `icicle-plist' bind
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to
;;  ((1 (face 'icicle-candidate-part))), so that the first part of
;;  each multi-completion candidate is highlighted using face
;;  `icicle-candidate-part'.
;;
;;  Here is another example value of
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist':
;;
;;  ((3 (face 'underline))
;;   (2 (invisible t) t))
;;
;;  The first entry underlines the third multi-completion part.  The
;;  second entry makes both the second part and the join string that
;;  follows it invisible.
;;
;;  One use of making a completion part invisible is so that you can
;;  sort candidates using it, and let users match input against it,
;;  but not have it appear explicitly.
;;
;;  Recall that `completing-read' displays only the car of each
;;  element present in its COLLECTION (alist) argument.  For example,
;;  if you pass `completing-read' an alist such as (("foo" . 2) ("bar"
;;  . 3)), then only `foo' and `bar' are displayed as candidates.
;;  However, the PREDICATE argument to `completing-read' applies to
;;  the entire alist element, and your command that calls
;;  `completing-read' might well use the chosen candidate (e.g. `foo')
;;  to look up the entire element (e.g. ("foo" . 2)) for further
;;  processing.  Several Icicles commands, including `icicle-search',
;;  do that.
;;
;;  However, sometimes you might want the user to be able to match
;;  against the additional information (e.g. 2 and 3), and you might
;;  want to use it to sort candidates.  In that case, you can use the
;;  alist (("foo 2") ("bar 3")).  In cases where the additional
;;  information can be distracting, you can use multi-completion with
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to hide it: Pass the alist
;;  ((("foo "2")) (("bar" 3"))) and use ((2 (invisible t))) for
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist'.
;;
;;  Keep in mind that hiding completion parts can be confusing to
;;  users.  Do so with care, and let your users know what to expect.
;;  Inform them that there are invisible parts that are nevertheless
;;  taken into account for input matching and candidate sorting.  When
;;  you hide parts, you will often want to omit them from the
;;  minibuffer as well, using `icicle-list-use-nth-parts', to avoid
;;  confusion.
;;
;;  Consider also the position of a hidden part: In some cases you
;;  might want to place it first among the multi-completion parts, but
;;  in many cases you will want to place it last, to minimize
;;  interference with prefix-completion matching.
;;
;;  Similar considerations apply to other text properties, such as
;;  `display' and `keymap', that change the appearance or behavior of
;;  a completion candidate.
;;
;;(@* "What You See Is Not What You Get")
;;  ** What You See Is Not What You Get **
;;
;;  While on the subject of confusing users, let me point out a
;;  general drawback that is common to both
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist': *not* WYSIWYG.  Keep this in
;;  mind if you decide to take advantage of these variables.  Users
;;  see one thing, choose it, and they get something different as a
;;  result.  That promotes confusion that you will need to weigh
;;  against the possible benefits.
;;
;;  Users are confused, because what they choose is not exactly what
;;  they get.  What's more, a user's completion choice is not
;;  reflected in the input history, leading to further confusion.  For
;;  example, Icicles highlighting of previously used inputs in buffer
;;  `*Completions*' does not apply to such a candidate, even though it
;;  was previously entered using `RET'.  It is the transformed
;;  candidate that was entered, not the candidate as it was proposed
;;  for choosing, so when that candidate is proposed again, it is not
;;  recognized as having been previously chosen.
;;
;;  The bottom line here is this: variables
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' are useful in certain
;;  contexts, but be aware of the downside: confusing your users.

;;  Candidates with Text Properties
;;  -------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Section (@> "Programming Multi-Completions") explains how to apply
;;  text properties to specific parts of all multi-completion
;;  candidates in buffer `*Completions*' at the same time.  This
;;  section tells you how to apply text properties to specific
;;  candidates in `*Completions*'.  The candidates need not be
;;  multi-completions, but in some cases they can be.
;;
;;  When you use candidates with text properties such as `face' that
;;  are visible, the display candidates in `*Completions*' show those
;;  properties.  In addition, the candidate string that the user
;;  finally chooses can also be propertized.
;;
;;  There are four different methods for providing candidates with
;;  text properties, in addition to the way presented in section
;;  (@> "Programming Multi-Completions"):
;;
;;  1. Apply face `icicle-special-candidate' to all candidates that
;;     match a given regexp.
;;
;;  2. Use a set of text properties as the `icicle-special-candidate'
;;     property of the symbol that represents the candidate.  The text
;;     properties are transferred to the string candidate that is
;;     displayed (and returned).
;;
;;  3. Use a propertized string as the `icicle-display-string'
;;     property of the symbol that represents the candidate.  That
;;     string replaces the candidate that would otherwise have been
;;     displayed, completed against, and returned.
;;
;;  4. Start with a propertized string in the COLLECTION argument
;;     that you pass to `completing-read'.
;;
;;  All four methods use fancy candidates, in the sense that they go
;;  beyond what vanilla Emacs offers.  For methods 1-3, you must turn
;;  on fancy-candidate handling.  See
;;  (@> "Programming with Fancy Candidates").
;;
;;  But method 4 does not require any costly fancy-candidate encoding
;;  or decoding, because the Icicles implementation of
;;  `completing-read' handles propertized string candidates, and they
;;  are transparent to the Emacs primitive completion operations.
;;
;;  The following sections explain methods 1-4 individually.
;;
;;(@* "Using Regexp `icicle-special-candidate-regexp'")
;;  ** Using Regexp `icicle-special-candidate-regexp' **
;;
;;  If you just want several candidates to have face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate' in `*Completions', you can simply
;;  define (e.g. bind) option `icicle-special-candidate-regexp' to a
;;  regexp that matches those candidates.  The original candidates can
;;  be strings or symbols.  Unlike the other methods described here,
;;  this one affects only the display in `*Completions'; the
;;  completion return string does not have face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.
;;
;;  The highlighting applies only to the part of a candidate that
;;  matches the regexp.  This selectivity is particularly useful when
;;  dealing with multi-completions.  Function `icicle-read-file-name'
;;  provides an example: file names that match ".+/$", that is,
;;  directory names, are highlighted as special candidates.  Function
;;  `icicle-read-color' provides another example (using the similar,
;;  but internal, variable `icicle-proxy-candidate-regexp'): proxy
;;  color-name candidates such as `*point foreground*' and
;;  `'icicle-region-background'' are highlighted, but not their color
;;  swatches.
;;
;;(@* "Using Property icicle-special-candidate")
;;  ** Using Property icicle-special-candidate **
;;
;;  In this approach, you use the desired list of text properties as
;;  the value of property `icicle-special-candidate' for the symbol
;;  that represents the candidate.  This method affects the candidates
;;  that are used during completion, as well as the completion return
;;  value.
;;
;;  If the candidate is a string, not a symbol, then `intern' it and
;;  put the property on the resulting symbol.  If you want the effect
;;  to be temporary, then set property `icicle-special-candidate' for
;;  the candidate to nil when completion is finished.
;;
;;  As a shortcut, if you use the value t instead of a property list
;;  for property `icicle-special-candidate', then face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate' will be used as the `face' property of
;;  the candidate.  Using a value of t is thus equivalent to using a
;;  value of (face icicle-special-candidate).  This approach is used,
;;  for instance, in the definition of command `icicle-complete-keys'
;;  (`S-TAB').
;;
;;(@* "Using Property `icicle-display-string'")
;;  ** Using Property `icicle-display-string' **
;;
;;  This method is similar to that of using property
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.  The use case for both is
;;  propertizing, in a general way, candidates that are symbols.  Both
;;  can be useful when you have an obarray as the COLLECTION argument
;;  for `completing-read'.
;;
;;  In this method the symbol name is not used at all; the candidate
;;  is entirely replaced by another string, which is typically
;;  propertized.
;;
;;  You use a propertized string as the value of property
;;  `icicle-display-string' for the candidate symbol.  The propertized
;;  string is displayed in `*Completions*' and returned as the final
;;  completion choice.
;;
;;  Note that multi-completion is not available when you use an
;;  obarray.  Using property `icicle-special-candidate' or
;;  `icicle-display-string' you can propertize candidates and parts of
;;  candidates, but you cannot manipulate multi-completion parts and
;;  there are no join or end strings.
;;
;;(@* "Applying Text Properties to a Candidate String")
;;  ** Applying Text Properties to a Candidate String **
;;
;;  This is the most flexible approach, and it is explained in a bit
;;  more detail.  It can be used with multi-completions, and it
;;  affects the `*Completions*' display and the completion return
;;  value.  However, it is limited to using an alist or list of
;;  strings, not an obarray, as the COLLECTION argument to
;;  `completing-read'.
;;
;;  In this approach, you simply apply the text properties to the
;;  string(s) that represent the candidate, which you then pass to
;;  `completing-read' in its COLLECTION parameter.
;;
;;  As with the other methods, you can use any text properties you
;;  like, including these:
;;
;;  * `face' - to make some completion candidates stand out in
;;    particular ways
;;
;;  * `icicle-mode-line-help' - candidate help shown in the mode-line
;;    when the candidate is current, provided option
;;    `icicle-help-in-mode-line-flag' is non-nil (only the first
;;    character of a candidate string is tested for this property)
;;
;;  * `help-echo' - candidate help shown in a mouseover tooltip,
;;    provided `tooltip-mode' is on
;;
;;  * `keymap' and `pointer' - for individualized mouse treatment of
;;    candidates
;;
;;  * `display' - to include images in candidates
;;
;;  * `invisible' - to hide part or all of particular candidates
;;    (which are nevertheless available for completion)
;;
;;  As a convenience, you can use function
;;  `icicle-candidate-short-help' to apply both
;;  `icicle-mode-line-help' and `help-echo' text properties to a
;;  candidate string.
;;
;;  How does this work?  Icicles redefines the standard Emacs function
;;  `display-completion-list' so that it retains text properties.
;;  Emacs should do the same, but it doesn't (yet).
;;
;;  Icicles command `icicle-read-color' presents an illustration,
;;  using the `face' property.  (It also uses properties
;;  `icicle-mode-line-help' and `help-echo', to provide RGB and HSV
;;  information in the mode-line and via tooltip.)
;;
;;  In `icicle-read-color', a multi-completion candidate is used,
;;  composed of an unpropertized string that names a color and a
;;  propertized string that names its RGB (red, green, blue) value.
;;  The RGB string, by default, has a background of the same color -
;;  each completion candidate is thus accompanied by its own color
;;  swatch.
;;
;;  The code that does this is function `icicle-make-color-candidate',
;;  which is used by `icicle-read-color' and other Icicles commands
;;  that read colors.  Here is a simplified definition:
;;
;;   (defun icicle-make-color-candidate (color-name)
;;     "Return candidate of COLOR-NAME and its hex RGB string.
;;   If `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' is non-nil, then the hex RGB
;;   string has the color as its background text property."
;;     (let ((rgb-string  (hexrgb-color-name-to-hex color-name)))
;;       (when icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag
;;         (put-text-property
;;           0 (length rgb-string) 'face
;;           (cons 'background-color rgb-string) rgb-string))
;;       (list (list color-name rgb-string))))
;;
;;  You'll notice that the face property is added only when option
;;  `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' is non-nil.  You can toggle this
;;  option at any time during completion to change the behavior.  (The
;;  new value takes effect for the next act of completion.)
;;
;;  You can match any part of the multi-completion: color name or RGB
;;  value.  Command `icicle-read-color' defines a set of sort orders
;;  that are pertinent to the color candidates.  You can use `C-,' to
;;  sort by color name, RGB value, hue, saturation, value, or amount
;;  of red, blue, or green.
;;
;;  If option `icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' is non-nil, then
;;  command `icicle-read-color' includes proxy completion candidates
;;  that are not color-name-and-RGB pairs.  As always, you can toggle
;;  the use of proxy candidates using `C-M-_' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  The proxy candidates for colors include the single-quoted names of
;;  user options (variables) whose custom type is `color'.  So, for
;;  example, option `icicle-region-background' appears as proxy color
;;  candidate `'icicle-region-background''. Color proxies also include
;;  the following:
;;
;;  * `*copied foreground*'  - last copied foreground, if available
;;  * `*copied background*'  - last copied background, if available
;;  * `*mouse-2 foreground*' - foreground where you click `mouse-2'
;;  * `*mouse-2 background*' - background where you click `mouse-2'
;;  * `*point foreground*'   - foreground under the text cursor
;;  * `*point background*'   - background under the text cursor
;;
;;  When you choose a proxy color candidates, the color referred to is
;;  used.  For example, `*point foreground*' means to use the
;;  foreground color at the cursor position (point), whatever it might
;;  be.  Choosing a `mouse-2' candidate lets you then click `mouse-2'
;;  to pick up a color somewhere.  If you use library `palette.el' or
;;  `eyedropper.el', and you have already copied a color, then you can
;;  choose `*copied foreground*' (or background) to use that color.
;;
;;  Icicles treats reading face names similarly to reading colors, by
;;  redefining standard function `read-face-name' when you are in
;;  Icicle mode.  In this case, multi-completions are not used.  The
;;  pertinent function is `icicle-make-face-candidate', which provides
;;  a WYSIWYG face sample whenever `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag'
;;  is non-nil.
;;
;;  A string value for `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' presents the
;;  face name accompanied by that string as a separate sample swatch.
;;  A value of t presents the face name itself in the face it names.
;;
;;   (defun icicle-make-face-candidate (face)
;;     "Return a completion candidate for FACE.
;;   The value of option `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' determines
;;   the kind of candidate to use.
;;    If nil, then the face name is used (a string).
;;
;;    If a string, then a multi-completion candidate is used, with the
;;    face name followed by a sample swatch using FACE on the string's
;;    text.
;;
;;    If t, then the candidate is the face name itself, propertized
;;    with FACE."
;;     (if (stringp icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag)
;;         (let ((swatch  (copy-sequence
;;                         icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag)))

;;  Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)
;;  ----------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;(@* "Nothing To It!")
;;  ** Nothing To It! **
;;
;;  Defining a command that uses Icicles completion and cycling is
;;  simple: just call `completing-read' or `read-file-name' to read
;;  input, then act on that input.
;;
;;  Nothing could be simpler - just use `completing-read'or
;;  `read-file-name'!  Icicles does the rest.  This is the most
;;  important thing to learn about defining Icicles commands: you
;;  don't need to do anything except call `completing-read' or
;;  `read-file-name' as you would normally anyway.
;;
;;  Or at least as I HOPE you would normally.  I fear that many
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers don't take sufficient advantage of
;;  `completing-read' when they could, using instead a function such
;;  as (quel horreur !)  `read-string' to read user input.
;;
;;(@* "Multi-Commands Are Easy To Define Too")
;;  ** Multi-Commands Are Easy To Define Too **
;;
;;  If defining an Icicles command is trivial, so is defining an
;;  Icicles multi-command.  For the same effort it takes to define a
;;  command that acts on a single input choice, you can have a command
;;  that acts on any number of input choices.  A multi-command takes
;;  advantage of one or more action functions when cycling candidates,
;;  as described in sections
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands"),
;;  (@> "More about Multi-Commands"), and
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Choose All Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  In fact, there is no reason NOT to define your commands as
;;  multi-commands - you lose nothing, and you gain a lot.  Whenever
;;  it is appropriate for a user to possibly want to act on multiple
;;  objects, define a multi-command that does that.
;;
;;  An anecdote, to make the point.  An Icicles user sent me an email
;;  saying how much he appreciated Icicles multi-commands, and asking
;;  if I would add a multi-command version of `insert-buffer'.  I did
;;  so, but I replied to him that the definition is trivial: it is
;;  identical to the definition of `icicle-buffer', except that the
;;  action function is `insert-buffer' instead of `switch-to-buffer'.
;;
;;  The point is to not be afraid of defining multi-commands yourself.
;;  You don't really need to have me add a multi-command to Icicles in
;;  most cases; you can easily define it yourself.  Here is a simple
;;  definition of `icicle-insert-buffer'.  You will understand it in
;;  detail after reading the next section.
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command icicle-insert-buffer
;;     "Multi-command version of `insert-buffer'." ; Doc string
;;     insert-buffer                               ;  Action function
;;     "Buffer: "                            ; `completing-read' args
;;     (mapcar #'(lambda (buf) (list (buffer-name buf))) (buffer-list))
;;     nil t nil 'buffer-name-history (icicle-default-buffer-names) nil)
;;
;;  Macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  make it easy to define a multi-command.  Without them, it is
;;  sometimes not so easy, depending on the complexity of your action
;;  functions.  See (@> "Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way") for a
;;  taste of what is involved.  If you read that section first, make
;;  sure you come back here to see how easy things can be.
;;
;;  Here is how you might define a multi-command to delete one or more
;;  files or directories:
;;
;;  1. Define the multi-command, `my-delete-file':
;;
;;  (icicle-define-file-command
;;   my-delete-file                  ; Command name
;;   "Delete a file or directory."   ; Doc string
;;   my-delete-file-or-directory     ; Function to perform the action
;;   "Delete file or directory: "    ; `read-file-name' arguments...
;;   default-directory nil t)
;;
;;  2. Define the action function that deletes a single file:
;;
;;  (defun my-delete-file-or-directory (file)
;;    "Delete file (or directory) FILE."
;;    (condition-case i-delete-file
;;        (if (eq t (car (file-attributes file)))
;;            (delete-directory file)
;;          (delete-file file))
;;      (error (message (error-message-string i-delete-file))
;;             (error (error-message-string i-delete-file)))))
;;
;;  There are two parts to the definition of `my-delete-file':
;;
;;  1. The definition of the command itself, using
;;     `icicle-define-file-command'.
;;
;;  2. The definition of an action function,
;;     `my-delete-file-or-directory', which deletes a single file (or
;;     directory), given its name.
;;
;;  It is #1 that is of interest here, because that is essentially
;;  what you do to define any multi-command.
;;
;;  The details of #2 are less interesting, even if more complex in
;;  this case: `my-delete-file-or-directory' checks whether its
;;  argument is a file or directory, and then tries to delete it.  If
;;  an error occurs, it prints the error message and then returns the
;;  message, so that the calling command can report on all deletion
;;  errors.
;;
;;  In #1, the arguments to `icicle-define-file-command' are
;;  straightforward:
;;
;;  * The name of the command being defined `my-delete-file'.
;;
;;  * Its doc string.
;;
;;  * The function that actually performs the action on the input file
;;    name - `my-delete-file-or-directory'.
;;
;;  * The arguments that you would supply anyway to `read-file-name'
;;    to read a single file name.
;;
;;  These are the SAME things you would need if you were defining a
;;  simple command to delete a SINGLE file or directory.  The only
;;  differences here are that you:
;;
;;  * Use `icicle-define-file-command' instead of `defun' with an
;;    `interactive' spec.
;;
;;  * Separate the action code into a separate function (here,
;;    `my-delete-file-or-directory') that acts on a single object
;;    (here, a file).
;;
;;  When you use `icicle-define-file-command', the action function is
;;  called on the result of `read-file-name', and it is also bound to
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn', so that it will be applied to the
;;  current candidate via `C-RET' or `C-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-all-candidates-action' (`C-!' -- see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Choose All Completion Candidates"))
;;  can report in buffer *Help* on the objects that it did not act
;;  upon successfully.  For this reporting to work, the function bound
;;  to `icicle-candidate-action-fn'
;;  (e.g. `my-delete-file-or-directory', above) should return `nil'
;;  for "success" and non-`nil' (for example, an error message) for
;;  "failure", whatever "success" and "failure" might mean in the
;;  particular context of use.  This is not a requirement, except if
;;  you want to take advantage of such reporting.  For a command that
;;  deletes files, it is important to let the user know which
;;  deletions failed when s?he tries to delete all matching candidates
;;  at once.
;;
;;  If the command you want to define acts on objects other than
;;  files, then use `icicle-define-command' instead of
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' - the only difference is that you
;;  then supply the arguments for `completing-read' instead of those
;;  for `read-file-name'.
;;
;;  To let users know that a command is a multi-command, and how to
;;  use it as such, `icicle-define-command' and
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' automatically add this explanation to
;;  the doc string you provide for the multi-command:
;;
;;  ---
;;  Read input, then call `<your action function name>' to act on it.
;;
;;  Input-candidate completion and cycling are available.  While
;;  cycling, these keys with prefix `C-' are active:
;;
;;  `C-mouse-2', `C-RET' - Act on current completion candidate only
;;  `C-down' - Move to next prefix-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-up'   - Move to previous prefix-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-next' - Move to next apropos-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-prior'- Move to previous apropos-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-!'    - Act on *all* candidates, successively (careful!)
;;
;;  When candidate action and cycling are combined (e.g. `C-next'), user
;;  option `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag' determines which occurs first.
;;
;;  With prefix `C-M-' instead of `C-', the same keys (`C-M-mouse-2',
;;  `C-M-RET', `C-M-down', and so on) provide help about candidates.
;;
;;  Use `mouse-2', `RET' or `S-RET' to finally choose a candidate, or
;;  `C-g' to quit.
;;
;;  This is an Icicles command - see `icicle-mode'.
;;  ---
;;
;;  Notice that the doc string of your new multi-command references
;;  your action function (e.g. `my-delete-file-or-directory').  The
;;  doc string you provide for the multi-command can thus be a little
;;  more abstract, leaving any detailed explanation of the action to
;;  the doc string of your action function.
;;
;;  To provide more flexibility, `icicle-define-command' and
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' provide some predefined key bindings
;;  and allow for additional arguments.
;;
;;  Here is a definition of a multi-command, `change-font', that reads
;;  a font name and changes the selected frame to use that font.
;;
;;  1  (icicle-define-command
;;  2   change-font "Change font of current frame."
;;  3   (lambda (font)
;;  4     (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  5                              (list (cons 'font font))))
;;  6   "Font: " (mapcar #'list (x-list-fonts "*"))
;;  7   nil t nil nil nil nil
;;  8   ((orig-frame  (selected-frame))
;;  9    (orig-font   (frame-parameter nil 'font)))
;;  10  nil
;;  11  (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  12                           (list (cons 'font orig-font)))
;;  13  nil)
;;
;;  The arguments to `icicle-define-command' here are as follows:
;;
;;  Command name    (line 2)
;;  Doc string      (line 2)
;;  Action function (lines 3-5)
;;  Args passed to `completing-read' (lines 6-7)
;;  Additional bindings (lines 8-9)
;;  Additional initialization code (line 10)
;;  "Undo" code to run in case of error or user quit (lines 11-12)
;;  Additional code to run at the end (line 13)
;;
;;  The following bindings are predefined - you can refer to them in
;;  the command body:
;;
;;   `orig-buff'   is bound to (current-buffer)
;;   `orig-window' is bound to (selected-window)
;;
;;  Before running any "undo" code that you supply, the original
;;  buffer is restored, in case of error or user quit (`C-g').
;;
;;  Most of the arguments to `icicle-define-command' are optional.  In
;;  this case, optional arguments were provided to save (lines 8-9)
;;  and then restore (lines 11-12) the original font and frame.

;;  `icicle-where-is'     - Show key sequences that invoke a command

;;  act on any number of items any number of times (e.g. kill one or
;;  more buffers).  I recommend that you follow a similar naming
;;  convention - remember that the doc string will let users know that
;;  the command can be used on multiple objects.
;;
;;  Macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  define a multi-command in a simple way.  Sometimes you will need a
;;  little more flexibility.  In that case, you can use higher-order
;;  functions `icicle-explore' and `icicle-apply' to define a
;;  multi-command.  See (@> "Defining Icicles Tripping Commands").
;;
;;(@* "Are Users Dependent on Icicles To Use Multi-Commands?")
;;  ** Are Users Dependent on Icicles To Use Multi-Commands? **
;;
;;  For users to be able to take advantage of the Icicles features
;;  that your multi-command provides, they must load Icicles.  You can
;;  do this for them, by adding (require 'icicles nil t) to your code.
;;  The last two arguments mean that no error will be raised if for
;;  some reason Icicles cannot be found or successfully loaded.
;;
;;  But that brings up another question: What happens to your
;;  multi-command if Icicles is not available for a user, or s?he
;;  doesn't want to load it? No problem - your multi-command then
;;  automatically turns into a normal, single-choice command -
;;  graceful degradation.
;;
;;  Similarly, users can always turn off `icicle-mode' at any time, to
;;  return to the standard Emacs behavior.
;;
;;  Users will, in any case, need to load Icicles at compile time, in
;;  order to byte-compile your library that calls macro
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command' - either
;;  that, or you can duplicate the definition of the macro in your
;;  library.  To let users load Icicles at (only) compile time, add
;;  this to your library that defines multi-commands:
;;
;;  (eval-when-compile '(require icicles))

;;  Defining Icicles Tripping Commands
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  Section (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icicles Tripping")
;;  describes the use of Icicles tripping (aka navigation or browsing)
;;  multi-commands.  This section tells you how to define your own
;;  such commands for custom trips - it is thus for Emacs-Lisp
;;  programmers.
;;
;;  The best way to learn how to do this is to look at how the
;;  existing tripping commands are defined.  Some of them use macro
;;  `icicle-define-command'; others do not.  Some use the
;;  building-block functions `icicle-explore' or `icicle-apply';
;;  others do not.  Several use `icicle-search' as a building block.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-define-command'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-define-command' **
;;
;;  Those that use `icicle-define-command' take advantage of some
;;  extraneous way to obtain trip location information from a display
;;  candidate, which is just a string.  For example, `icicle-bookmark'
;;  ultimately uses the display string to look up location information
;;  in a bookmarks file.  Those that use `icicle-explore' or
;;  `icicle-apply' make use of location information stored in the
;;  alist COLLECTION argument to `completing-read'.
;;
;;  You can also use `icicle-define-command', `icicle-explore', and
;;  `icicle-apply' to define multi-commands other than browsing
;;  commands - the action function can do anything you like.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-explore'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-explore' **
;;
;;  `icicle-explore' is a higher-order function that takes as
;;  arguments the following functions, in addition to accepting
;;  the optional `completing-read' arguments.
;;
;;  * A function to build a candidates alist (COLLECTION) for
;;    completion.  It fills `icicle-candidates-alist' with the
;;    candidates, each of which is a cons with a display candidate
;;    string as car and (typically) location information as cdr.  For
;;    example, `icicle-find-tag' uses the tag text as display
;;    candidate and the standard tag-locating information as the cdr:
;;    tag info, file path, and goto function.
;;
;;  * A function that acts on the candidate finally chosen (`RET'),
;;    when completion is finished.
;;
;;  * A function to call if the user hits `C-g' during completion.
;;
;;  * A function to call if an error is raised during completion.
;;
;;  * A function to call after completion is finished, to clean things
;;    up.
;;
;;  If you also bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that
;;  takes a display candidate (string) as argument and navigates to
;;  the corresponding location, then `icicle-explore' does everything
;;  you need for an Icicles trip.  You can use function
;;  `icicle-get-alist-candidate' to get the location information for a
;;  given display candidate.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-apply'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-apply' **
;;
;;  `icicle-apply' binds `icicle-candidate-action-fn' appropriately
;;  and calls `icicle-explore'.  It applies its function argument to
;;  completion candidates the user acts on (using `C-RET' etc.).  It
;;  applies the function to the full alist entry, that is, the display
;;  candidate car plus any additional information in the cdr.  For a
;;  tripping command, the additional information provides a location
;;  and the function applied takes you there.
;;
;;  This use of an alist that stores location information in the cdrs
;;  is what makes `icicle-apply' and `icicle-explore' particularly
;;  suitable for defining navigation multi-commands.  The Icicles
;;  macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  make no such provision, but with suitable arguments you can use
;;  them too to define tripping commands.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-search'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-search' **
;;
;;  `icicle-search' is another high-level function for defining
;;  tripping commands.  Like `icicle-apply', it calls
;;  `icicle-explore', but it also provides features for searching
;;  bookmarks, buffers, and files.  It takes as arguments the search
;;  limits (region), if any, and either a regexp or a function that
;;  determines the unfiltered search hits.  It does everything else
;;  needed to define a trip command that uses search hits as
;;  completion candidates.  Several predefined Icicles tripping
;;  commands were defined using `icicle-search'.
;;
;;(@* "Tripping on Foot")
;;  ** Tripping on Foot **
;;
;;  You should be able to define any tripping commands you need using
;;  `icicle-explore', `icicle-apply', or `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  If, however, for some reason you decide to define one at a lower,
;;  pedestrian level (that is, without using any of those building
;;  blocks), then bind `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to `t'
;;  around the call to `completing-read'.  You can then use
;;  `icicle-get-alist-candidate' to retrieve the candidate cdr
;;  (e.g. location) information from the completion result.
;;
;;  However, if the action or alternate action function that you need
;;  modifies the existing set of completion candidates on the fly, as
;;  a side effect, then bind `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p'
;;  to `nil' in the action function.  Then modify both
;;  `minibuffer-completion-table' and `icicle-candidates-alist' as
;;  needed to perform the side effect.
;;
;;  Icicles search-and-replace provides an example of this.  When you
;;  replace text, the original domain of search-hit candidates (with
;;  their associated location information) is altered, so that you can
;;  continue replacing coherently.  (See the code for
;;  `icicle-search-action' and
;;  `icicle-search-highlight-and-maybe-replace'.)
;;
;;  Because such side effects can change the meaning of cycling state
;;  information such as the current candidate number, Icicles does not
;;  automatically save such state information before a candidate
;;  action and then restore it afterward.
;;
;;  For example, search-and-replace removes a search-hit candidate, as
;;  a side effect, if the replacement text no longer matches your
;;  input.  In that case, a current candidate number recorded before
;;  the action would no longer correspond to the same candidate.
;;
;;  For this reason, if your action function does not perform any such
;;  side effects on the candidates, and you want to restore the
;;  cycling state as it was before a candidate action, then you might
;;  want your action function to save and then restore the values of
;;  Icicles variables such as `icicle-candidate-nb',
;;  `icicle-last-completion-candidate', and
;;  `icicle-completion-candidates'.

;;
;;  Defining Multiple-Choice Menus
;;  ------------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles multi-commands (see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands")) can be
;;  used provide users with multiple-choice menus.  While the possible
;;  choices can be accessed by minibuffer completion or cycling, a
;;  user can also display them in buffer `*Completions*' using `TAB'
;;  or `S-TAB', and click them there to choose them.
;;
;;  That is, buffer `*Completions*' can act as a multiple-choice menu.
;;
;;  Simple use case: Suppose that you use special characters (Greek
;;  letters, math symbols, accented letters in another language...),
;;  but only occasionally - you don't want to take the trouble to
;;  learn a special input method for them or flip to a different soft
;;  keyboard.  One simple way to handle this is to create a menu of
;;  such special characters - Greek letters, for instance.  You only
;;  need to create the menu once, providing the necessary completions
;;  as, say, Unicode characters.  When you need to input such a
;;  character, just use your command that pops up buffer
;;  `*Completions*' with the available special characters.  Even if
;;  you don't know how to type them on your keyboard, you can cycle
;;  through them or use `mouse-2' to choose them.
;;
;;  Here's a simple example of defining a command that uses a
;;  multiple-choice menu.  (Other examples given above, such as
;;  `my-delete-file-or-directory' are also examples, but this one uses
;;  menu items that look more like menu items.)
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command my-menu-command
;;      "Display menu and act on choice(s)."
;;      my-menu-action
;;      "`TAB' for menu.  `C-mouse-2' to choose. "
;;      my-menu-items nil t)
;;
;;  (defvar my-menu-items
;;    '(("Foobar" . foobar-fn) ("Toto" . toto-fn) ("Titi" . titi-fn))
;;    "Alist of menu items and their associated commands.")
;;
;;  (defun my-menu-action (item)
;;    "Call function associated with menu-item ITEM."
;;    (funcall (cdr (assoc item my-menu-items))))
;;
;;  (defun foobar-fn () (message "Foobar chosen"))
;;  (defun toto-fn () (message "Toto chosen"))
;;  (defun titi-fn () (message "Titi chosen"))
;;
;;  A user does `M-x my-menu-command' and hits `TAB' to display this
;;  menu in the `*Completions*' buffer:
;;
;;  Click mouse-2 on a completion to select it.  (C-h: help)
;;
;;  Possible completions are:
;;  Foobar          Titi
;;  Toto
;;
;;  The user presses and holds the Control key.  S?he clicks `Foobar'
;;  - message "Foobar chosen" appears.  S?he clicks `Toto - message
;;  "Toto chosen" appears.
;;
;;  And so on - all while holding Control pressed.  Any number of menu
;;  items can be chosen, any number of times.  The command is finally
;;  exited with `RET' or `C-g'.
;;
;;  The COLLECTION argument passed to `completing-read' here is
;;  `my-menu-items', an alist of key-value pairs, where the key is a
;;  menu-item name and the value is the function that implements the
;;  menu item.  For example, menu item `Foobar' is implemented by
;;  function `foobar-fn', and the alist element is therefore ("Foobar"
;;  . foobar-fn).
;;
;;  Function `my-menu-action' is executed when a user clicks
;;  `C-mouse-2' on a menu item.  It just looks up the menu item's
;;  function in alist `my-menu-items', and then calls that function.
;;
;;  What?  You think it's odd that the user must hit `TAB' to display
;;  the menu?  Then just use this code instead:
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command
;;   my-menu-command
;;   "Display menu and act on choice(s)."
;;   my-menu-action
;;   "`C-mouse-2' or `C-RET' to choose menu items"
;;   my-menu-items nil t nil nil nil nil
;;   ((icicle-show-*Completions*-initially-flag t)))
;;
;;  This just adds a binding for
;;  `icicle-show-*Completions*-initially-flag', so that
;;  `*Completions*' is displayed initially.
;;
;;  Granted, the `*Completions*' display doesn't exactly look like
;;  your average menu.  And the header line doesn't mention the
;;  multiple-choice possibility (holding Control while clicking).  But
;;  the header does say to use `C-h' for help, and that help does
;;  mention `C-mouse-2' (as does the prompt).  And the menu does act
;;  like a menu.  And the doc string of `my-menu-command' can provide
;;  more help, as needed.
;;
;;  There are also some freebie advantages of using such menus,
;;  besides the feature of multiple-choice.  These include choosing
;;  menu items from the keyboard, with completion, and cycling among
;;  menu items.  The additional features are all explained when the
;;  user hits `C-?'.
;;
;;  One common use of a multiple-choice menu is letting the user
;;  select a list of items from a larger list of candidates.  The list
;;  is returned, with the items in the order selected.  Examples of
;;  this include these multi-commands:
;;
;;  * `icicle-bookmark-list' - bookmark names
;;
;;  * `icicle-buffer-list' - buffer names, selected from `buffer-list'
;;    (possibly after filtering)
;;
;;  * `icicle-directory-list' - directory names, selected from
;;    subdirectories in the current directory and any directories you
;;    navigate to
;;
;;  * `icicle-face-list' - face names, selected from `face-list'
;;
;;  * `icicle-file-list' - file names, selected from files in the
;;    current directory and any directories you navigate to
;;
;;  * `icicle-keyword-list' - keywords (regexps), selected from those
;;    you have previously entered
;;
;;  * `hlt-choose-faces', `hlt-choose-visible-faces',
;;    `hlt-choose-invisible-faces' - face names, selected from the
;;    (visible/invisible) highlighting faces in the buffer
;;
;;  Such commands can be used on their own, or they can be used in the
;;  `interactive' specs of other commands that act on an entire list
;;  of selected items.  And don't forget that the set of "menu items"
;;  (completion candidates) is susceptible to sorting in various ways,
;;  as well as filtering in the usual ways: progressive completion,
;;  chipping away the non-elephant, and so on.
;;
;;  Here as an example definition is `icicle-file-list':
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command icicle-file-list
;;     "Choose a list of file names.
;;   The list of names (strings) is returned."

;;  ** How Multi `M-x' is Defined **
;;
;;  The definition of `icicle-execute-extended-command' provides an

;;  candidate action function itself binds a candidate action
;;  function, in case the candidate is a command that reads input with

;;     (set-buffer orig-buff) ; bound by `icicle-define-command'.

;;       (let ((enable-recursive-minibuffers  t))
;;         (call-interactively (intern cmd-name) 'record-it))))
;;
;;  The last seven lines of this action function rebind
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that calls the
;;  candidate `cmd-name' on a single argument that it reads.  This is
;;  useful if `cmd-name' is a command that, itself, reads an input
;;  argument with completion.  When that is the case, you can use
;;  completion on that input, and if you do that, you can use `C-RET'
;;  to use command `cmd-name' as a multi-command.  In other words,
;;  this binding allows for two levels of multi-commands.
;;
;;  There are a few things wrong with this definition, however.  In
;;  the action function, the candidate command is applied to a
;;  candidate that is a string.  What if it is a command, such as
;;  `describe-variable', that expects a symbol argument?  Or a number
;;  argument?  There is no way to know what kind of command will be
;;  used, and what kind of argument it will need.  The solution is to
;;  first try a string candidate argument, then convert the string to
;;  a symbol or number.  That is, bind this to
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn':
;;
;;  (lambda (x)
;;    (condition-case nil
;;        (funcall cmd x)    ; Try to use a string candidate.  If that
;;      (wrong-type-argument ; didn't work, use a symbol or number.
;;       (funcall cmd (car (read-from-string x))))))
;;
;;  A similar problem occurs if the action function called doesn't
;;  accept a (single) argument.  The best thing to do in this case is
;;  punt - call `icicle-help-on-candidate' to display help on the
;;  candidate. To the code above, we add another error handler:
;;
;;  (wrong-number-of-arguments (funcall #'icicle-help-on-candidate))
;;
;;  And what if the command `cmd' does something that changes the
;;  focus away from the minibuffer's frame?  That's the case for
;;  `describe-variable', for instance: it selects buffer `*Help*'.  To
;;  fix this potential problem, the action function needs to reset the
;;  focus back to the minibuffer frame:
;;
;;  (lambda (x)
;;    (condition-case nil
;;        (funcall cmd x)
;;      (wrong-type-argument (funcall cmd (car (read-from-string x))))
;;      (wrong-number-of-arguments
;;       (funcall #'icicle-help-on-candidate)))
;;    (select-frame-set-input-focus
;;      (window-frame (minibuffer-window))))
;;
;;  The actual definitions of the action function and the main command
;;  are even more complex.  They need to take into account various
;;  subtleties, including those associated with recursive minibuffers
;;  and multiple invocations of `completing-read'.  Evaluate, for
;;  example, (symbol-function 'icicle-execute-extended-command) to see
;;  the real definition.

;;
;;  Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way
;;  ------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.  It gives you a taste
;;  of what is involved behind the scene when you effortlessly use
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command' to define
;;  a multi-command.
;;  See (@> "Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)").
;;
;;  It can be good to know this, if only for the case where you need
;;  to define a multi-command that has special behavior not provided
;;  by `icicle-define(-file)-command' out of the box.  For example, if
;;  you want the normal, single-choice `RET' behavior to be different
;;  from the multiple-choice `C-RET' behavior, then you might want to
;;  roll your own.  Likewise, if you want to define your own help on
;;  individual candidates, to be invoked when users use `C-M-RET' and
;;  so on.
;;
;;  To write your own multi-command, you must make the command do
;;  this:
;;
;;  1. Call `completing-read' or `read-file-name', and perform some
;;     action on the completed input.
;;
;;  2. Bind one or more of these variables to action functions, which
;;     each take a completion candidate as argument:
;;
;;     a. `icicle-candidate-action-fn' - a function that performs an
;;        action on a completion candidate - often the same action as
;;        #1.
;;
;;     b. `icicle-candidates-list-action-fn' - a function that
;;        performs an action on the list of all completion candidates.
;;
;;     c. `icicle-candidate-alt-action-fn' - a function that performs
;;        an alternative action on a completion candidate.
;;
;;     d. `icicle-candidates-list-alt-action-fn' - a function that
;;        performs an alternative action on the list of candidates.
;;
;;     e. `icicle-candidate-help-fn' - a function that displays
;;        specialized help for a completion candidate.
;;
;;        (You can also provide mode-line help and tooltip help for
;;        individual candidates.
;;        See "Candidates with Text Properties".)
;;
;;     f. `icicle-delete-candidate-object' - a function that deletes
;;        an object associated with (e.g. named by) a completion
;;        candidate.
;;
;;  #1 just lets people use the command normally, to perform the #1
;;  action on a completion candidate entered with `RET'.  Because of
;;  #2, people can perform the #2 action(s) on any completion
;;  candidates, while still continuing to cycle or complete
;;  candidates.  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' is often the same as the
;;  action for #1, but nothing prevents you from using different
;;  actions.
;;
;;  When internal variable `icicle-candidate-action-fn' is not bound,
;;  the default action is performed: display help on the current
;;  completion candidate.  When `icicle-candidate-help-fn' is not
;;  bound, the default help display is used.
;;
;;  Instead of binding `icicle-delete-candidate-object' to a deletion
;;  action function, you can bind it to a symbol (variable) whose
;;  value is a list of completion-candidate objects.
;;  See (@> "More about Multi-Commands") for more information.
;;
;;  Here is a definition of a simple (not multi-) command that reads a
;;  font name and then changes the selected frame to use that font.
;;  By virtue of calling `completing-read', Icicles completion and

;;
;;  As you can see, there is a lot more going on here than in the
;;  simple-command version.  These are the points to keep in mind,
;;  when defining a multi-command by hand:
;;
;;  1. Save anything you need to restore, so you can, in effect, undo
;;     the action in case of `C-g' (lines 4-5).
;;
;;  2. Bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to the action to perform
;;     (lines 6-11).

;;  3. Perform the action, using `completing-read' to provide the
;;     target candidate (lines 13-20).  Do this in the body of a
;;     `condition-case' (lines 12-24).
;;
;;  4. Restore the original context in the error-handling part of the

;;(@* "Global Filters")
;;
;;  Global Filters
;;  --------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Which completion candidates get displayed?  To review:
;;
;;  1. The domain of discourse, that is, all possible candidates, is
;;     determined by the arguments to `completing-read',
;;     `read-file-name', or `M-x'.
;;
;;  2. A user types something in the minibuffer.  This narrows the
;;     possible candidates to those that match the input.  Matching
;;     can be prefix-matching or apropos-matching.
;;
;;  Wouldn't it sometimes be useful to filter #1 in a global way,
;;  before filtering it with the user input (#2)?  Functions
;;  `completing-read' and `read-file-name' take a predicate argument,
;;  so that can be used for global filtering.  However, those
;;  functions are usually called from some command, and it would also
;;  be useful to give end users, not just programmers, some way to
;;  globally filter candidates.
;;
;;  For example, if you have a command, such as `icicle-buffer', that
;;  reads a buffer name and displays the buffer, some users might
;;  always be interested only in buffers that are associated with
;;  files.  They don't want to see possible candidates like
;;  `*scratch*' and `*Messages*'.  What they need is a way to apply a
;;  global predicate that limits candidates to file-buffer names - but
;;  they don't have access to the call to `completing-read' that is
;;  inside the command definition.
;;
;;  For this reason, some global filtering variables are provided by
;;  Icicles:
;;
;;    `icicle-must-match-regexp', `icicle-must-not-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-must-pass-predicate', `icicle-extra-candidates'.
;;
;;  The first and second of these are regexps that candidates must
;;  match and must not match, respectively, in order for them to be
;;  displayed.  The third is a predicate that candidates must satisfy.
;;  The fourth is a list of extra candidates to display.  Any of the
;;  filters can be nil, in which case it has no effect.
;;
;;  Each of these except `icicle-extra-candidates' filters not only
;;  completion candidates but also the default values passed to
;;  `completing-read' and `read-file-name'.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-must-match-regexp' is similar to the standard
;;  variable `completion-regexp-list', except:
;;
;;  * `completion-regexp-list' is a list of regexps, not just one.
;;  * `icicle-must-match-regexp' is used after filtering using option
;;    `icicle-transform-function'.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-extra-candidates' is not really a "filter".  It
;;  does not restrict the set of possible candidates - rather, it
;;  extends that set.  The other filters do not act on the candidates
;;  in `icicle-extra-candidates' - they are always added.  Extra
;;  candidates are displayed in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;  `icicle-extra-candidate'.
;;
;;  Note that an extra candidate need not have anything in common with
;;  the normal (non-extra) candidates.  In particular, because it is
;;  provided explicitly, it does not follow the restrictions implied
;;  by the current candidate-generation method.  For example, when
;;  option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-nil, the extra
;;  shell-command candidates provided have no connection with the
;;  file-name completion that is used to generate the other candidates
;;  (see (@* "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements")).
;;
;;  Note too that if an extra candidate is already a candidate anyway
;;  then it will be present twice in the list of all candidates (that
;;  is, unless `icicle-transform-function' removes duplicate
;;  candidates).
;;
;;  These global variables are internal variables, even though they
;;  are defined as user options - they are not really meant to be
;;  customized.  If you are not an Emacs-Lisp programmer, you will not
;;  use these variables, but some commands that you use might provide
;;  corresponding global-filter user options.  Icicles provides
;;  customizable user options for Icicles buffer commands, such as
;;  `icicle-buffer'.  For example:
;;
;;    `icicle-buffer-match-regexp'    - Regexp buffer names must match
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp' - Regexp buffers must not match
;;    `icicle-buffer-predicate'       - Predicate buffers must satisfy
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras'          - Extra buffer names to display
;;
;;  You might, for instance, customize `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp'
;;  to not display file-buffers whose names end in `.elc', and
;;  customize `icicle-buffer-predicate' to show only buffers that are
;;  associated with files.  The former would use a value of "\\.elc$",
;;  and the latter would use a value such as this:
;;
;;     (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))
;;
;;  Similarly, Icicles provides user options for filtering and sorting
;;  file names during completion:
;;
;;    `icicle-file-match-regexp'    - Regexp file names must match
;;    `icicle-file-no-match-regexp' - Regexp file names must not match
;;    `icicle-file-predicate'       - Predicate files must satisfy
;;    `icicle-file-extras'          - Extra file names to display
;;
;;  If you, as a programmer, write a command, and you want to expose
;;  global filters to users of the command, you should:
;;
;;  1. Create corresponding user options that can be customized.
;;  2. Bind the user options to the corresponding filtering variables.
;;
;;  If you use `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  to define a command (recommended), then you can simply pass the
;;  filter-variable bindings as part of the BINDINGS argument.
;;
;;  For example, here is the core definition of `icicle-buffer':
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command
;;    icicle-buffer                          ; Command name
;;    "Switch to a different buffer."        ; Doc string
;;    switch-to-buffer                       ; Action function
;;    "Switch to buffer: "                   ; completing-read args
;;    (mapcar (lambda (buf) (list (buffer-name buf))) (buffer-list))
;;    nil nil nil 'buffer-name-history
;;    (icicle-default-buffer-names) nil
;;    ;; Filter bindings
;;    ((icicle-must-match-regexp      icicle-buffer-match-regexp)
;;     (icicle-must-not-match-regexp  icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp)
;;     (icicle-must-pass-predicate    icicle-buffer-predicate)
;;     (icicle-extra-candidates       icicle-buffer-extras)
;;     (icicle-sort-comparer          icicle-buffer-sort)))
;;
;;  If you define a command that uses completion, but you don't use
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command', then you
;;  can just bind such variables around a call to `completing-read' or
;;  `read-file-name'.  Command `icicle-complete-keys' presents an
;;  example of this, binding `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp'.
;;
;;  Another way that users can apply predicates to completion
;;  candidates is to use `M-&' while completing.  These predicates
;;  apply to the full alist-entry candidates that are supplied to
;;  `completing-read' or `read-file-name', not just to the textual
;;  candidates that are displayed in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Progressive Completion").
 
;;(@* "Specifying Match Functions for Commands")
;;
;;  Defining Commands that Use Specific Match Functions
;;  ---------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  By default, Icicles lets users use basic prefix completion (with
;;  `TAB') or apropos completion (with `S-TAB'). They can
;;  alternatively use other completion methods with `TAB' and `S-TAB':
;;
;;  * They can use `C-(' during completion to cycle among `TAB'
;;    completion methods.
;;
;;  * They can use `M-(' to cycle among `S-TAB' completion
;;    methods.
;;
;;  * They can customize options `icicle-TAB-completion-methods-alist'
;;    and `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist', to define the
;;    completion methods among which they can cycle.
;;
;;  When you define an Icicles command, you can specify which
;;  string-matching functions the command uses during completion:
;;
;;  * If you want the command to use fuzzy completion for `TAB' by
;;    default, then bind `icicle-fuzzy-completion-flag' to
;;    non-`nil'. Users can still use `C-(' to toggle fuzzy completion
;;    off.
;;
;;  * If you want the command to use a particular string-matching
;;    function for `S-TAB' completion by default, then bind variable
;;    `icicle-apropos-complete-match-fn' to that function. Users can
;;    still use `M-(' to cycle among the other matching functions for
;;    `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  You can bind `icicle-apropos-complete-match-fn' to any function
;;  that matches strings.  You will probably also want to ensure that
;;  it is available for `M-(' cycling, by adding it to
;;  `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist' in a `let' binding.  For
;;  example, to use matching function `my-match' in `my-cmd', you
;;  might do this:
;;
;;  (defun my-cmd ()
;;    "..."
;;    (interactive)
;;    (let ((icicle-apropos-complete-match-fn  'my-match)
;;          (icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist
;;           (cons (cons "mine" 'my-match)
;;                 icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist)))
;;        (do-something (completing-read "Choose: " ...) ...)))
 
;;(@* "Defining Buffer-Text Completion for Comint Modes")
;;
;;  Defining Buffer-Text Completion for Comint Modes
;;  ------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Out of the box, Icicles provides completion for buffer text in
;;  some contexts.  This includes Shell mode, for example.  Whenever
;;  there are two or more candidate completions, you can use Icicles
;;  completion, with all of its features (cycling, progressive
;;  completion, apropos completion, and so on).
;;  See (@> "Completion in Comint Modes").
;;
;;  Shell mode is an example of a mode that inherits from Comint mode.
;;  Other libraries sometimes define modes that also extend Comint
;;  mode in different ways.  Library ESS does so, for example.
;;
;;  In such modes, the top-level completion command used is typically
;;  `comint-dynamic-complete', and it is typically bound to `TAB'.  In
;;  Icicle mode, `TAB' in such a buffer is instead bound to the
;;  Icicles version of this command, `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete'.
;;
;;  Icicles provides the infrastructure for you to take advantage of
;;  Icicles completion with your own modes that inherit from Comint
;;  mode.  For that, just do the following:
;;
;;  1. Define replacement functions for the functions that perform the
;;     completion.  The functions to be replaced themselves typically
;;     call a Comint completion function, such as
;;     `comint-dynamic-complete-filename'.  You can typically use the
;;     same definitions as the original functions, except replace the
;;     call to a function that displays multiple matching candidates
;;     by a call to a corresponding Icicles function that performs
;;     completion.
;;
;;  2. Customize option `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements',
;;     adding the mappings that specify which standard functions to
;;     replace with your completion functions (from #1).  Take a look
;;     at the default value of this option to see what I mean.
;;
;;  3. Use `eval-after-load' to toggle Icicle mode when the vanilla
;;     code for your mode is loaded, to ensure that the original
;;     definitions are picked up.  See the end of `icicles-mode.el'
;;     for an example of this.
;;
;;  If you are interested in trying this, take a look at the Icicles
;;  code for, say, `icicle-shell-dynamic-complete-command', comparing
;;  it with the original code for `shell-dynamic-complete-command'.
;;  You will see that the only change is to substitute a call to
;;  `icicle-shell-dynamic-complete-as-command' for a call to
;;  `shell-dynamic-complete-as-command'.  Likewise,
;;  `icicle-shell-dynamic-complete-as-command' is a trivial alteration
;;  of `shell-dynamic-complete-as-command'.
;;
;;  The key is to ultimately call an Icicles completion command, such
;;  as `icicle-comint-dynamic-simple-complete', whenever there are
;;  multiple completion candidates.  This has the effect of using
;;  Icicles minibuffer completion instead of simply displaying the
;;  alternatives in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  Icicles uses this same technique, of substituting Icicles
;;  completion for simple display of alternatives, for all buffer-text
;;  completion that it supports out of the box, even when there is no
;;  relation with Comint mode.
 
;;(@* "Note to Programmers")
;;
;;  Note to Programmers
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  Here are some simple guidelines for using Icicles in Emacs-Lisp
;;  programming:
;;
;;  1. *Use it*!  Even if you don't do anything else, include this in
;;     your library:
;;
;;     (require 'icicles nil t)
;;
;;     That has absolutely no consequences if Icicles is not present
;;     in the user's `load-path' (there is no load error).  If Icicles
;;     is present, however, then users can take advantage of each use
;;     you make of `completing-read' and `read-file-name' in your
;;     code.
;;
;;  2. Use an input-completion read function, such as
;;     `completing-read' or `read-file-name', when you read input!
;;     There is almost never a reason not to use an input-completion
;;     function when reading user input - especially considering that
;;     you need not always provide a REQUIRE-MATCH argument.
;;
;;     Try also to find an appropriate PREDICATE argument, and a good
;;     set of default values to pass to `completing-read' as its
;;     COLLECTION argument.  Too often, I think, we use an overly
;;     general COLLECTION argument, such as the `obarray', and we
;;     don't provide a (good) PREDICATE.  Using an input-completion
;;     function with an appropriate candidate completion list and
;;     predicate can help users considerably.
;;
;;     If you want to also give users a way to customize a (different)
;;     predicate that applies only to the textual candidates that are
;;     displayed in buffer `*Completions*', as opposed to the full
;;     alist-entry candidates that are supplied to `completing-read'
;;     or `read-file-name', then you can define a new user option and
;;     then bind internal variable `icicle-must-pass-predicate' to the
;;     value of that option. See (@> "Global Filters").
;;
;;  3. Avoid using a literal-string `interactive' spec (e.g.
;;     (interactive "fFile: ")) that reads input with completion.
;;     Instead, call `completing-read' or `read-file-name' within the
;;     `interactive' spec.  This saves Icicles users of progressive
;;     completion the need to hit `RET' multiple times to pass their
;;     input up through multiple levels of recursive minibuffers to
;;     the top level.  See
;;     (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Progressive Completion").
;;
;;  4. In many cases, it makes sense to define a multi-command, rather
;;     than a simple command.  People can always use a multi-command
;;     as a simple command, but not vice versa.
;;     See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands"),
;;     (@> "Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)"),
;;     and (@> "Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way").
;;
;;  5. Consider using `icicle-completing-read-history' instead of
;;     `read-from-minibuffer' or `read-string' for most purposes.
;;     This lets users complete their input against previously entered
;;     input.  Completion is lax, so they can also enter new input.
;;
;;  6. You can bind `icicle-sort-comparer' temporarily to any sort
;;     function you need.
;;
;;  7. Function `icicle-next-candidate' is a general framework for
;;     letting users cycle completions of partial input strings.  I
;;     use it to define the cycling behavior for both prefix and
;;     apropos completions.  You can use it to easily define other,
;;     application-specific input matching/completion/cycling
;;     behavior.  Just supply it with a function that takes the
;;     current partial user input (a string) and returns a list of
;;     candidate completions, however those might be defined.
;;
;;  8. If the potential number of completion candidates is enormous,
;;     then icompletion display in `*Completions*' can be slow.  In
;;     that case, consider turning it off for the duration of the
;;     command, by binding `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' to
;;     nil.  An alternative to turning it off is the approach taken in
;;     Icicles (e.g. `icicle-vardoc' and
;;     `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'): Just add a reminder to the
;;     doc string to tell users that they can toggle
;;     `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' with `C-#'.
;;
;;  9. Another of my libraries that can help programmers provide
;;     default values is `thingatpt+.el'.  It provides functions for
;;     picking up symbols, sexps, numbers, words, and other sorts of
;;     thing near the text cursor (`point').

;;
;;  1. This library started life as `elect-mbuf.el', by Hans Koomen.
;;
;;    Original posting:

;;    Subject: elect-mbuf.el
;;    Date: Tue, 13 Jun 89 15:17:07 -0400
;;
;;  2. I hacked and enhanced the library in various relatively minor
;;  ways over the years, maintaining it as `elect-mbuf.el' - see
;;  details in file `icicles-chg.el'.
;;
;;  I did not change the main functionality of the library during this
;;  period: it always cycled the COMPLETE list of (prefix) completion
;;  candidates passed to `completing-read'; it did not update the
;;  candidate list based on the current minibuffer contents.
;;
;;  So, for instance, if you had `M-x for' in the minibuffer, `down'
;;  would cycle among ALL Emacs commands, not just those that start
;;  with "for".  I used the library this way for fifteen years without
;;  thinking much about this behavior or the code behind it.
;;
;;  3. In July 2005, Lennart Borgman gave `elect-mbuf.el' a quick try,
;;  and intuitively expected to see behavior along the lines that you
;;  see now for Icicles prefix completion:
;;
;;  a. `down' should cycle completions relative to the current input,
;;     not all completions supplied to `completing-read'.
;;  b. If buffer `*Completions*' is displayed, `down' should highlight
;;     the current candidate there.
;;
;;  Good idea Lennart (<lennart.borgman.073@student.lu.se>).  So I
;;  implemented that behavior, and renamed the library "Icicles" (for,
;;  I suppose, "input cycles" or some such - or because it's "cool").
;;
;;  4. The code changes I made to implement #3 (completion cycling
;;  relative to current input) made me realize that other completion
;;  matchings could be implemented in a similar way.  Prefix
;;  completion (the completion provided by Emacs) is handy, but it is
;;  also sometimes a bit limited.  The idea of apropos completion
;;  occurred to me, and I implemented that as well.
;;
;;  5. I extended the library quite a bit more, in terms of
;;  convenience (highlighting, treatment of buffer
;;  `*Completions*',..., but also in terms of functionality.  In
;;  particular, it now treats file names too.  And, because Emacs 21
;;  and later versions use `read-file-name' for `find-file' and so on,
;;  Icicles now treats `read-file-name' the same as `completing-read'.
;;
;;  6. On another suggestion from LennartBorgman, I made Icicles take
;;  advantage of Delete Selection mode.  And I implemented it as a
;;  minor mode.
;;
;;  7, 8, 9,...  One thing has led to another, and I've just kept
;;  adding features.  Feature creep, I guess.  But the more I play
;;  with Icicles, the more I imagine new ways it might be made more
;;  useful.

;;  Note on Non-nil `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows
;;  ---------------------------------------------
;;
;;  If you use `pop-up-frames' = t, like I do, you might have noticed
;;  that Emacs completion does not play well with using separate
;;  frames for each buffer.  In particular, it does not play well with
;;  having a separate frame for buffer `*Completions*'.  When you try
;;  to complete input using `TAB', a new frame is created for buffer
;;  `*Completions*', and, at least on MS Windows, it is selected,
;;  taking the input focus away from the original frame's minibuffer!
;;
;;  This means that, once the `*Completions*' buffer has been
;;  displayed in a separate frame, you cannot, for instance, cycle
;;  completion candidates, without first reselecting the original
;;  frame manually.  You cannot even use normal completion - you
;;  cannot add text in the minibuffer, or delete text there, because
;;  the minibuffer in the original frame no longer has the input
;;  focus.  Bummer.
;;
;;  In general, Emacs does not play too well with one-buffer-per-frame
;;  (`pop-up-frames' = t), and this is a good example of that general
;;  problem.
;;
;;  I reported this Emacs bug.  I've been hoping it will be corrected
;;  since Emacs 21...
;;
;;  I don't have this problem of loss of frame input focus in my own
;;  setup, even though I use `pop-up-frames' = t, because I use my
;;  library `oneonone.el'.  (Try it!)  If you need a solution while
;;  waiting for the Emacs fix, you can try doing something similar to
;;  what I do in `oneonone.el':
;;
;;  1. Use dedicated frames for both `*Completions*' and the
;;     minibuffer.
;;
;;  2. Display buffer `*Completions*' using a special-display function
;;     that explicitly redirects the input focus from the
;;     `*Completions*' frame back to the minibuffer frame.
