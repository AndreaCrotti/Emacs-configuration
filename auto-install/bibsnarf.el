;;; bibsnarf --- get BibTeX format bibliography entries from the net

;; Author: Hans Halvorson (hhalvors -at- princeton -dot- edu) 
;; Version: 0.2 
;; Time-stamp: <13-04-2011, 15:37>

;;; Commentary: 
;;
;; This program searches simultaneously through several bibliography
;; databases, and produces a summary of the results.  You can then
;; view records (using "v"), append records to other buffers (usingz
;; "c"), or append records into local BibTeX files (using "f").
;;
;; As of January 26, 2007, the supported search backends are:
;;
;;   MathSciNet:   www.ams.org/mathscinet (requires a subscription)
;;   citebase:     www.citebase.org
;;   math arxive:  front.math.ucdavis.edu
;;   spires-hep:   www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/
;;
;; In theory, it is easy to add any backend for which a single URL 
;; returns an html page with BibTeX formatted entries.
;; If you know of any such additional backends, please email the maintainer.
;;
;; To start a search: M-x bibsnarf RET 
;; You will then be queried for Author and Title (you need only enter one of the two fields).
;; If everything goes well, in a few short seconds you will 
;; find yourself in a buffer that summarizes your results, one line
;; per result.  The following keybindings apply in the summary buffer:
;;
;;   v   - view the full BibTeX entry for the record at the point
;;   SPC - ditto
;;   RET - ditto
;;   f   - append the full BibTeX of the record at the point to some local file
;;         (*CAUTION*: if you have made modifications to the file and have not saved, then you will 
;;         lose your changes!  For that case, you should instead use "a"
;;   c   - append the full BibTeX of the record at the point to some buffer
;;
;;  At present, all search results are dumped into a single buffer.  But it would not be diffcult
;;  to arrange things differently.
;;
;; 
;; Technical discussion: Here is what actually happens after you ask bibsnarf to search:
;; 1. bibsnarf figures out which urls to get
;; 2. bibsnarf calls an external browser (e.g. links) to download the urls.  
;;    (Why not a native emacs browser, e.g. w3?  For one, w3 is no longer maintained.  
;;    Second, using an external browser allows us to do asynchronous downloads.  Maybe that is also 
;;    possible with w3; I don't know.)
;; 3. bibsnarf processes each downloaded html page in two stages: (a) It cleans out the html cruft, 
;;    hopefully (!) resulting in a valid BibTeX file. (b) It parses the BibTeX file by turning each 
;;    valid entry into a hash table whose keys are field names and whose values are field contents, and 
;;    then it makes a big hash table called *bib* whose keys are random, and whose values are the entry 
;;    hash tables. into a hash table called '*bib*'.  Question: would it be better just to store the entries 
;;    in a list?  Does hashing provide any advantage ;; in this case?  
;; 4. bibsnarf writes out a summary string for each entry in *bib* in the buffer *bibsnarf results*.
;;

;; requires an external web client: e.g., links, w3m, lynx

;; TO DO: use async from url.el

;; TO DO: add SciTation support, eprintweb.org support

;; Acknowledgments: Much of the code is inspired by Eric Marsden's
;; watson.el, and some is borrowed from Nevin Kapur's bibfind.el.
