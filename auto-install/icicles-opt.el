;;  will no longer have any effect.  With the exception of options
;;  `icicle-mode' and `icicle-mode-hook', library `icicles-opt.el'
;;  always contains the complete set of Icicles options.  If your
;;  custom file or init file contains an Icicles option that is not
;;  listed above, then you can remove it because it is obsolete.

;;  If you have library `linkd.el' and Emacs 22 or later, load

   `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys'     (forward apropos)
 - `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'  (backward prefix)
   `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys'      (forward prefix)

Non-nil means that you can use a single set of keys (`up' and `down',
by default) to cycle both kinds of completion.  The keys are the
values of `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys' (backward) and
`icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys' (forward).

The completion mode, and hence the behavior of these keys, is changed
whenever you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' during completion: the mode is
prefix completion after `TAB' and `apropos' completion after `S-TAB'.

Before you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', the cycling behavior depends on the
particular non-nil value of the option:

- `prefix'  means cycle prefix completions
- `apropos' means cycle apropos completions
- Any other non-nil value means cycle inputs from the input history

For example, if the value is `apropos' then you can immediately cycle
apropos completions without first hitting `S-TAB'.

Once you have used `TAB' or `S-TAB', the only way to traverse the
history is using `M-p' and `M-n' - `up' and `down' will cycle
completions.

Note: If the option is non-nil you can still use `M-p' and `M-n' to
traverse the input history, and `prior' and `next' to cycle apropos
completions (assuming that those default keys have not been changed).

And if you customize either the modal cycling keys or the prefix
cycling keys so that they are different (e.g. one of those sets is no
longer `up'/`down'), then you can also still use the latter.  In this
case, you need not use `TAB' and `S-TAB' to switch between the two
completion types, even when this option is non-nil - you can use the
separate apropos and prefix cycling keys.

After you change the value of this option, toggle Icicle mode off,
then on again, for the change to take effect in the same session."

  "*How to treat the default value when reading minibuffer input.

When the default value argument to functions such as
`completing-read', `read-file-name', `read-from-minibuffer', and
`read-string' is non-nil and the initial-input argument is nil or
\"\", the default value can be added to the prompt as a hint or
inserted into the minibuffer as the initial input.

Adding it to the prompt is the default behavior and corresponds to the
behavior of vanilla Emacs.

Inserting the default value in the minibuffer as the initial input has
the advantage of not requiring you to use `M-n' to retrieve it.  It
has the disadvantage of making you use `M-p' (or do something else) to
get rid of the default value in the minibuffer if you do not want to
use or edit it.  If you often want to use or edit the default value,
then set `icicle-default-value' to non-nil and non-t.  If you rarely
do so, then set it to nil or t.

If inserted in the minibuffer, the value of this option also
determines whether or not the inserted text is preselected and where
the cursor is left: at the beginning or end of the text.

These are the possible option values:

  nil               - Do not insert default value or add it to prompt.
  t                 - Add default value to prompt.  Do not insert it.
  `insert-start'    - Insert default value and leave cursor at start.
  `insert-end'      - Insert default value and leave cursor at end.
  `preselect-start' - Insert and preselect default value;
                      leave cursor at beginning.
  `preselect-end'   - Insert and preselect default value;
                      leave cursor at end.

My own preference is `insert-end'.

Preselection can be useful in Delete Selection mode or PC Selection
mode.  It makes it easy to replace the value by typing characters, or
delete it by hitting `C-d' or `DEL' (backspace).  However, all of the
initial input is lost if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL'.  That is
inconvenient if you want to keep most of it and edit it only slightly."

You can use `\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\\[icicle-goto/kill-failed-input]' \
to go to the start of the highlighted part.
Repeat to kill it.

This highlighting can have a negative impact on performance, because
it can mean recomputing completion candidates multiple times, in order
to determine the longest part that completes.  For this reason, you
can fine tune when you want this highlighting to occur.  The values of
this option and options
`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay' and
`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold' determine when
the highlighting can take place.

In particular, highlighting the non-matching part of remote file names
can be slow.  Two values of this option allow remote file name
highlighting: `always' and `explicit-remote'.  The other values do not
highlight remote file names.  You probably do not want to use a value
of `always'.

If the value is nil, then highlighting never occurs.  If the value is
`explicit-strict', `explicit', or `explicit-remote', then highlighting
occurs only upon demand: when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to request
completion.  If the value is `implicit-strict', `implicit', or
`always', then highlighting occurs also when you update your input
during incremental completion.

If the value is `implicit-strict' or `implicit', then highlighting
occurs not only upon demand but also during incremental completion if
`icicle-incremental-completion-flag' is non-nil.  Remember that you
can toggle incremental completion, using `C-#' in the minibuffer.

I use a value of `implicit' myself, but the default value is
`implicit-strict' because, depending on your setup and use cases,
`implicit' can impact performance for file-name completion (which is
lax, not strict).  I suggest you try `implicit' to see - this feature
is especially useful for file names.

Summary of choices for when to highlight:

nil               Never
`explicit-strict' When you hit `TAB'/`S-TAB' for strict completion
`explicit'        When you hit `TAB'/`S-TAB'
`explicit-remote' When you hit `TAB'/`S-TAB', including remote files
`implicit-strict' During strict completion
`implicit'        During lax or strict completion
`always'          Always, even for names of remote files

After highlighting, you can use `C-M-l' to move the cursor to the
start of the mismatch, for editing there.  You can use a second
`C-M-l' to kill (delete) the mismatch up to the next input line (if
any).  You can repeat `C-M-l' to kill additional input lines.

Actually, what you enter is interpreted as a single regexp to be

A good value for this option is a string that:

 2) visually separates the two strings it joins, and
 3) is not too difficult or too long to type.

The default value is \"^G\^J\", that is, control-g followed by
control-j (newline):
 1) ^G does not normally occur in doc strings
 2) a newline visually separates the multiple component strings, which
    helps readability in buffer *Completions*
 3) you can type the value using `C-q C-g C-q C-j'.

For readability (in Emacs 22 and later), the default value has a

you easily see which buffer the candidate applies to.  Also, the
buffer name is part of the candidate, so you can match against it.

  "*Predicate or predicates for sorting (comparing) two items.
Used in particular to sort completion candidates.  In that case, this
determines the order of candidates when cycling and their order in
buffer *Completions*.

When `icicle-cycle-into-subdirs-flag' is non-nil, you might want to
use a function such as `icicle-dirs-last-p' for this option, to
prevent cycling into subdirectories depth first.  Command
`icicle-sort-by-directories-last' does that.

You can cycle completion sort orders at any time using `C-,' in the
minibuffer.

Although this is a user option, it may be changed by program
locally, for use in particular contexts.  In particular, you can bind
this to nil in an Emacs-Lisp function, to inhibit sorting in that
context.

Various sorting commands change the value of this option dynamically
\(but they do not save the changed value).

The value must be one of the following:

* nil, meaning do not sort

* a predicate that takes two items as args

* a list of the form ((PRED...) FINAL-PRED), where each PRED and
  FINAL-PRED are binary predicates

If the value is a list of predicates, then each PRED is tried in turn
until one returns a non-nil value.  In that case, the result is the
car of that value.  If no non-nil value is returned by any PRED, then
FINAL-PRED is used and its value is the result.

Each PRED should return `(t)' for true, `(nil)' for false, or nil for
undecided.  A nil value means that the next PRED decides (or
FINAL-PRED, if there is no next PRED).

Thus, a PRED is a special kind of predicate that indicates either a
boolean value (as a singleton list) or \"I cannot decide - let the
next guy else decide\".  (Essentially, each PRED is a hook function
that is run using `run-hook-with-args-until-success'.)

Examples:

 nil           - No sorting.

 string-lessp  - Single predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

 ((p1 p2))     - Two predicates `p1' and `p2', which each return
                 (t) for true, (nil) for false, or nil for undecided.

 ((p1 p2) string-lessp)
               - Same as previous, except if both `p1' and `p2' return
                 nil, then the return value of `string-lessp' is used.

Note that these two values are generally equivalent, in terms of their
effect (*):

 ((p1 p2))
 ((p1) p2-plain) where p2-plain is (icicle-make-plain-predicate p2)

Likewise, these three values generally act equivalently:

 ((p1))
 (() p1-plain)
 p1-plain        where p1-plain is (icicle-make-plain-predicate p1)

The PRED form lets you easily combine predicates: use `p1' unless it
cannot decide, in which case try `p2', and so on.  The value ((p2 p1))
tries the predicates in the opposite order: first `p2', then `p1' if
`p2' returns nil.

Using a single predicate or FINAL-PRED makes it easy to reuse an
existing predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

You can also convert a PRED-type predicate (which returns (t), (nil),
or nil) into an ordinary predicate, by using function
`icicle-make-plain-predicate'.  That lets you reuse elsewhere, as
ordinary predicates, any PRED-type predicates you define.

Note: As a convention, predefined Icicles PRED-type predicate names
have the suffix `-cp' (for \"component predicate\") instead of `-p'."

The available methods can include these:

1. `basic'
2. `vanilla' (provided you have Emacs 23 or later)
3. `fuzzy'   (provided you have library `fuzzy-match.el')
4. `swank'   (provided you have library `el-swank-fuzzy.el')

1. Basic completion means ordinary prefix completion. It is the
`basic' completion style of Emacs 23 or later, and it is essentially
the completion style prior to Emacs 23 (Emacs 22 completion was
slightly different - see Emacs 23 option `custom-styles' for more
info).

2. Vanilla completion respects option `completion-styles' (new in
Emacs 23), so that `TAB' behaves similarly in Icicles to what it does
in vanilla Emacs.  The vanilla method also completes environment
variables during file-name completion and in shell commands.  The
non-vanilla methods do not complete environment variables, but the
variables are expanded to their values when you hit `RET'.

3. Fuzzy completion is a form of prefix completion in which matching
finds the candidates that have the most characters in common with your
input, in the same order, and with a minimum of non-matching
characters.  It can skip over non-matching characters, as long as the
number of characters skipped in the candidate is less that those
following them that match.  After the matching candidates are found,
they are sorted by skip length and then candidate length.

Fuzzy completion is described in detail in the commentary of library
`fuzzy-match.el'.  There is no fuzzy completion of file names - fuzzy
completion is the same as basic for file names.  Fuzzy completion is
always case-sensitive.

4. Swank completion in Icicles is the same as fuzzy completion, except
regarding symbols.  That is, swank completion per se applies only to
symbols.  Symbols are completed using the algorithm of library
`el-swank-fuzzy.el'.

Icicles options `icicle-swank-timeout' and
`icicle-swank-prefix-length' give you some control over the behavior.
When the `TAB' completion method is `swank', you can use `C-x 1'
\(`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-timeout+') and `C-x 2'
\(`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-prefix-length+') in the minibuffer to
increment these options on the fly using the arrow keys `up' and
`down'.

Swank symbol completion uses heuristics that relate to supposedly
typical patterns found in symbol names.  It also uses a timeout that
can limit the number of matches.  It is generally quite a bit slower
than fuzzy completion, and it sometimes does not provide all
candidates that you might think should match, even when all of your
input is a prefix (or even when it is already complete!).  If swank
completion produces no match when you think it should, remember that
you can use `\\[icicle-next-TAB-completion-method]' on the fly to \
change the completion method.


If you do not customize `icicle-TAB-completion-methods', then the
default value (that is, the available `TAB' completion methods) will
reflect your current Emacs version and whether you have loaded
libraries `fuzzy-match.el' and `el-swank-fuzzy.el'.

By default, `TAB' is the key for this completion. The actual keys
used are the value of option `icicle-prefix-complete-keys'.

  "*Yank function.  A function that takes a prefix argument.  This
should be a command that is bound to whatever key you use to yank
text, whether in Icicle mode or not.  In Icicle mode, command
`icicle-yank-maybe-completing' calls this function, except when
`icicle-yank-maybe-completing' is called from the minibuffer or called
with a negative prefix argument.  `icicle-yank-maybe-completing'
passes the raw prefix argument to `icicle-yank-function'.

By default (see option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'), the command
that is the value of this option is remapped to
`icicle-yank-maybe-completing' the first time you enter Icicle mode.
If you customize `icicle-yank-function', then, to take advantage of
this default remapping behavior, you will need to save your
customization and then restart Emacs.

Alternatively, you can customize both `icicle-yank-function' and the
corresponding entry in `icicle-top-level-key-bindings', and then
toggle Icicle mode off and then back on."

KEY is either a key sequence (string or vector) to bind COMMAND to or

COMMAND is bound according to the value of KEY, unless the result of

For convenience, you can use insert each key in the key description by

`C-c M-k' you can use `C-q C-c C-q M-k'.

  "*Alist of Emacs object types and associated actions.
Each element has the form (TYPE FUNCTION...), where TYPE names an
object type, and each FUNCTION accepts an object of type TYPE as its
only required argument

A FUNCTION here can be a symbol or a lambda form.  You can use a
symbol that is not yet `fboundp', that is, one that does not yet have
a function definition.  Any symbols that do not have function
definitions when this option is used are simply filtered out.

However, just because a function is defined at runtime does not mean
that it will work.  For example, function `buffer-size' is included in
the default value for type `buffer', but in Emacs 20 `buffer-size'
accepts no arguments, so applying it to a buffer name raises an error.

\[Note: If you have suggestions or corrections for the default value,
send them in, using `\\[icicle-send-bug-report]'.  The initial list
was drawn up quickly by looking at functions with the type in their
name and that accept a value of that type as only required argument.
There is no doubt that the default value could be improved.]"

If you write Emacs-Lisp code, you can bind this to non-nil during
completion in contexts where it makes little sense for users to act on
the same candidate more than once.  That way, users cannot choose it
