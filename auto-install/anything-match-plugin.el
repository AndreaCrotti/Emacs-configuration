;;; Commentary:

;; Change anything.el matching algorithm humanely.
;; It gives anything.el search refinement functionality.
;; exact match -> prefix match -> multiple regexp match

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `anything-grep-candidates-fast-directory-regexp'
;;    *Directory regexp where a RAM disk (or tmpfs) is mounted.
;;    default = nil

;; A query of multiple regexp match is space-delimited string.
;; Anything displays candidates which matches all the regexps.
;; A regexp with "!" prefix means not matching the regexp.
;; To include spaces to a regexp, prefix "\" before space,
;; it is controlled by `anything-mp-space-regexp' variable.

;; If multiple regexps are specified, first one also tries to match the source name.
;; If you want to disable this feature, evaluate
;;   (setq anything-mp-match-source-name nil) .

;; This file highlights patterns like `occur'. Note that patterns
;; longer than `anything-mp-highlight-threshold' are highlighted. And
;; region out of screen is highlighted after
;; `anything-mp-highlight-delay' seconds.
;;
;; Highlight in Emacs is time-consuming process for slow computers. To
;; disable it is to set nil to `anything-mp-highlight-delay'.

;; Just require it to use.

It is MUCH FASTER than normal match-plugin to search from vary large (> 1MB) candidates.
Make sure to install these programs.

It expands `candidates' and `delayed' attributes.

`grep-candidates' attribute accepts a filename or list of filename.
It also accepts 0-argument function name or variable name.")
