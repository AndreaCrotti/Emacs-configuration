;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Someone like to reuse the current dired buffer to visit
;; another directory, so that you just need open one dired
;; buffer. but the bad point is ,you can't  easily go
;; forward and back in different dired directory. this file
;; can remember dired directory you have visited and list them
;; using `anything.el'.
;; `anything-dired-history.el' will save all dired directory you
;; have visited to file `anything-dired-history-cache-file'
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; (require 'anything-dired-history)
;; (setq anything-dired-history-cache-file "~/.emacs.d/dired-history")
;; (define-key dired-mode-map "," 'anything-dired-history-view)
;;
;; Or:
;; (autoload 'anything-dired-history-view "anything-dired-history"
;;    "view dired directories you have visited." t)        
;; (setq-default anything-dired-history-cache-file "~/.emacs.d/dired-history")
;; (define-key dired-mode-map "," 'anything-dired-history-view)
;;
