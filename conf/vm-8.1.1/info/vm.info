Introduction
************

VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read
and disposed of within Emacs.  Commands exist to do the normal things
expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other more
advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating digests,
message forwarding, and organizing message presentation according to
various criteria.

   You can make VM your default mail user agent by setting
`mail-user-agent' to `vm-user-agent', e.g. by `M-x'
`customize-variable' `RET' `mail-user-agent' `RET'.

   To invoke VM, type `M-x vm'.  VM gathers any mail that has arrived
in your system mailbox and appends it to a file known as your "primary
inbox", and visits that file for reading.  *Note Starting Up::.  A file
visited for reading by VM is called the "current folder".

   If you type `?' in a VM folder buffer you will get some help, i.e.
`vm-help' is called.

   If there are any messages in the primary inbox, VM selects the first
new or unread message, and previews it.  "Previewing" is VM's way of
showing you part of a message and allowing you to decide whether you
want to read it.  *Note Previewing::.  By default VM shows you the
message's sender, recipient, subject and date headers.  Typing <SPC>
(`vm-scroll-forward') exposes the body of the message and flags the
message as read.  Subsequent <SPC>'s scroll forward through the
message, `b' or <DEL> scrolls backward.  When you reach the end of a
message, typing <SPC> or `n' moves you forward to preview the next
message.  *Note Viewing::.

   If you do not want to read a message that's being previewed, type
`n' and VM will move to the next message (if there is one).  *Note
Selecting Messages::.

   To save a message to a mail folder use `s' (`vm-save-message').  VM
will prompt you for the folder name in the minibuffer.  *Note Saving
Messages::.

   Messages are deleted by typing `d' (`vm-delete-message') while
previewing or reading them.  The message is not removed right away; VM
makes a note that you want the message to be removed later.  If you
change your mind about deleting a message, select it and type `u'
(`vm-undelete-message'), and the message will be undeleted.  *Note
Deleting Messages::.  The actual removal of deleted messages from the
current folder is called "expunging" and it is accomplished by typing
`###' (`vm-expunge-folder').  The message is still present in the
on-disk version of the folder until the folder is saved.

   Typing `h' (`vm-summarize') causes VM to display a window containing
a summary of the contents of the current folder.  The summary is
presented one line per message, by message number, listing each
message's author, date sent, line and byte count, and subject.  Also,
various letters appear beside the message number to indicate that a
message is new, unread, flagged for deletion, etc.  An arrow `->'
appears to the left of the line summarizing the current message.  The
summary format is user configurable, *note Summaries::.

   When you are finished reading mail the current folder must be saved,
so that the next time the folder is visited VM will know which messages
have been already read, replied to and so on.  Typing `S'
(`vm-save-folder') saves the folder.  Note that deleted messages are
_not_ expunged automatically when you save a folder.  The next time you
visit the folder any deleted messages will still be flagged for
deletion.

   When a folder is first visited, the value of the variable
`vm-folder-file-precious-flag' is used to initialize a buffer-local
instance of `file-precious-flag', which determines how folders are
saved.  A non-nil value causes folders to be saved by writing to a
temporary file and then replacing the folder with that file.  A nil
value causes folders to be saved by writing directly to the folder
without the use of a temporary file.

   If the folder is empty at the time you save it and the variable
`vm-delete-empty-folders' is non-`nil', VM will remove the zero length
folder after saving it.

   To quit visiting a folder you can type `q' (`vm-quit') or `x'
(`vm-quit-no-change').  Typing `q' saves the current folder before
quitting.  Also, any messages flagged new are changed to be flagged as
old and unread, before saving.  The `x' command quits a folder without
changing the status of new messages, saving or otherwise modifying the
current folder.

   If the variable `vm-confirm-quit' is set to `t' VM will always ask
for confirmation before ending a VM visit of a folder.  A `nil' value
means VM will ask only when messages will be lost unwittingly by
quitting, i.e. not removed by intentional delete and expunge.  A value
that is neither `nil' nor `t' causes VM to ask only when there are
unsaved changes to message attributes or when messages will be lost.

   You do not have to quit a folder to continue using Emacs for other
purposes.  (`vm-quit-just-bury') buries the buffers associated with the
current folder deep in Emacs' stack of buffers, but otherwise leaves
the folder visited so that you can resume reading messages quickly.  You
can locate the folder's buffers again by using `list-buffers', which is
normally bound to `C-x C-b'.

   Another command you can use if you are using a window system like X
Windows is `vm-quit-just-iconify'.  This command buries the folder's
buffers like `vm-quit-just-bury' and also iconifies the current frame.

   At any time while reading mail in any folder you can type `g'
(`vm-get-new-mail') to check to see if new mail for that folder has
arrived.  If new mail has arrived it will be moved from the spool files
or maildrops associated with the current folder and merged into the
folder.  If you are not in the middle of another message, VM will also
move to the first new or unread message.

   If `vm-get-new-mail' is given a prefix argument, it will prompt for
another file from which to gather messages instead of the usual spool
files.  In this case the source folder is copied but no messages are
deleted from it as they would be for a spool file.

   By default your primary inbox has your system mailbox associated with
it, e.g. `/var/spool/mail/kyle', and so typing `g' will retrieve mail
from this file.  Your system mailbox is one example of a "spool file",
a file that the mail transport system delivers messages into.  You can
associate other spool files with your primary inbox and spool files
with other folders by setting the variable `vm-spool-files'.  *Note
Spool Files::.

1 Starting Up
*************

The first time VM is started in an Emacs session, it attempts to load
the file specified by the variable `vm-init-file', normally `~/.vm'.
If present this file should contain Lisp code, much like the `.emacs'
file.  Since VM has well over one hundred configuration variables, use
of the `~/.vm' can considerably reduce clutter in the `.emacs' file.
You can reload this file by typing `L' (`vm-load-init-file') from
within VM.

   `M-x vm' causes VM to visit a folder known as your "primary inbox",
specified by the variable `vm-primary-inbox'.  If the variable
`vm-auto-get-new-mail' is set non-`nil', VM will gather any new mail
that has arrived and integrate it into your primary inbox.  The default
setting for your primary inbox is the local file `~/Mail/inbox', but a
variety of other options are available.

   VM can work with mail folders saved on the local file system.  *Note
Local Folders::.  It can also work with mail folders stored on remote
mail servers, such as POP and IMAP servers.  *Note Server Folders::.
Server folders have the advantage that they can be accessed from
multiple locations on the internet.  VM might appear to have a bias
towards local folders due to its history of development.  But it treats
server folders with equal facility.

   `M-x vm-visit-folder' (`v' from within VM) allows you to visit any
local mail folder.  The folder name will be prompted for in the
minibuffer.  `M-x vm-visit-pop-folder' and `M-x vm-visit-imap-folder'
perform similar function for server folders.

   Once VM has read the folder and assimilated any new mail, the first
new or unread message will be selected, if any.  If there is no such
message, VM will select whatever the selected message was when this
folder was last saved.  If this folder has never been visited and saved
by VM, then the first message in the folder is selected.

   `M-x vm-mode' can be used on a buffer already loaded into Emacs to
put it into the VM major mode so that VM commands can be executed on
it.  This command is suitable for use in Lisp programs, and for
inclusion in `auto-mode-alist' to automatically start VM on a file
based on a particular filename suffix.  `vm-mode' skips some of VM's
start-up procedures (e.g. starting up a summary) to make
non-interactive use easier.

   The variable `vm-startup-with-summary' controls whether VM
automatically displays a summary of the folder's contents at startup.  A
value of `nil' gives no summary; a value of `t' always gives a summary.
A value that is a positive integer N means that VM should generate a
summary if there are N or more messages in the folder.  A negative
value -N means generate a summary only if there are N or fewer
messages.  The default value of `vm-startup-with-summary' is `t'.

1.1 Local Folders
=================

A local mail folder is simply a file that can be stored on the local
file system.  VM works with the Unix "mbox" format to store messages in
folders.  It can also work with the "Babyl" format used by the Emacs
Rmail package.  The subtypes of mboxes handled by VM are listed in the
documentation of the variable `vm-default-folder-type'.

   A "spool file" is a file where the mail transport system delivers
messages intended for you.  On Unix systems, a program called
`/bin/mail' or `/bin/mail.local' does this delivery, although agents
such as `procmail', `filter' and `slocal' can be invoked from a user's
`~/.forward' or `~/.qmail' files.  On other systems, incoming mail is
typically delivered to mailboxes on remote mail servers, from where it
can be retrieved through protocols like POP and IMAP.  No matter what
the delivery agent, what all spool files have in common is that mail is
delivered into them by one or more entities apart from VM and that all
access to spool files must therefore be accompanied by the use of some
file locking protocol.

   VM leaves the task of accessing spool files to `movemail', a program
distributed with Emacs that is written for this purpose.  The variable
`vm-movemail-program' specifies the name of the movemail program and
defaults to `"movemail"'.  The variable `vm-movemail-program-switches'
lets you specify some initial command line argument to pass to the
movemail program.

   VM transfers the mail from a spool file to a folder via a temporary
file known as the "crash box".  The variable `vm-crash-box' names the
crash box file for the primary inbox.  VM first copies the mail to the
crash box, truncates the system mailbox to zero messages, merges the
crash box contents into the primary inbox, and then deletes the crash
box.  If the system or Emacs should crash in the midst of this
activity, any message not present in the primary inbox will be either
in the system mailbox or the crash box.  Some messages may be
duplicated but no mail will be lost.

   If the file named by `vm-crash-box' already exists when VM is
started up, VM will merge that file with the primary inbox before
retrieving any new messages from the system mailbox.

Spool Files
-----------

Every folder, including the primary inbox, can have one or more spool
files associated with it.  You make these associations known to VM by
setting the variable `vm-spool-files'.

   If you only want to associate spool files with your primary inbox,
you can set `vm-spool-files' to a list of strings.  By default, the
location of your system mailbox (the spool file that is associated with
your primary inbox) is determined heuristically based on what type of
system you're using.  VM can be told explicitly where the system
mailbox is by setting `vm-spool-files' like this:

     (setq vm-spool-files '("/var/spool/mail/kyle" "~/Mailbox"))

With this setting, VM will retrieve mail for the primary inbox from
first `/var/spool/mail/kyle' and then `~/Mailbox'.

   If the value of `vm-spool-files' is `nil', a default value for
`vm-spool-files' will be inherited from the shell environmental
variables MAILPATH or MAIL if either of these variables are defined.
This inheritance happens before your init file is loaded, so setting
`vm-spool-files' in your init file will override any environmental
variables.

   If you want to associate spool files with folders other than or in
addition to the primary inbox, the value of `vm-spool-files' must be a
list of lists.  Each sublist specifies three entities, a folder, a spool
file and a crash box.  When retrieving mail for a particular folder, VM
will scan `vm-spool-files' for folder names that match the current
folder's name.  The spool file and crash box found in any matching
entries will be used to gather mail for that folder.

   For example, you can set `vm-spool-files' like this

     (setq vm-spool-files
           '(
             ("~/INBOX"      "/var/spool/mail/kyle"      "~/INBOX.CRASH")
             ("~/INBOX"      "~/Mailbox"                 "~/INBOX.CRASH")
             ("~/Mail/bugs"  "/var/spool/mail/answerman" "~/Mail/bugs.crash")
            )
     )

The folder `~/INBOX' has two spool files associated with it in this
example, `/var/spool/mail/kyle' and `~/Mailbox'.  Another folder,
`"~/Mail/bugs"' has one folder `/var/spool/mail/answerman' associated
with it.  Note that both of the `~/INBOX' entries used the same crash
box.  The crash box can be the same if the folder name is the same.
Different folders should use different crashboxes.

   An alternate way of specifying folder/spool file associations is to
use the variables `vm-spool-file-suffixes' and `vm-crash-box-suffix'.

   The value of `vm-spool-file-suffixes' should be a list of string
suffixes to be used to create possible spool file names for folders.
Example:

     (setq vm-spool-file-suffixes '(".spool" "-"))

With `vm-spool-file-suffixes' set this way, if you visit a folder
`~/mail/beekeeping', when VM attempts to retrieve new mail for that
folder it will look for mail in `~/mail/beekeeping.spool' and
`~/mail/beekeeping-' in addition to scanning `vm-spool-files' for
matches.  The value of `vm-spool-files-suffixes' will not be used
unless `vm-crash-box-suffix' is also defined, since a crash box is
required for all mail retrieval from spool files.

   The value of `vm-crash-box-suffix' should be a string suffix used to
create possible crash box file names for folders.  When VM uses
`vm-spool-file-suffixes' to create a spool file name, it will append
the value of `vm-crash-box-suffix' to the folder's file name to create
a crash box name.  If the value of `vm-spool-files-suffixes' is `nil',
then the value of `vm-crash-box-suffix' is not used by VM.

   The idea behind `vm-spool-file-suffixes' and `vm-crash-box-suffix'
is to give you a way to have many folders with individual spool files
associated with them, without having to list them all in
`vm-spool-files'.  If you need even more control of spool file and
crash box names, use `vm-make-spool-file-name' and
`vm-make-crash-box-name'.  The value of both of these should be a
function or the name of a function.  When VM visits a folder, it will
call the function with the name of the folder as an argument, and the
function should return the spool file name or crash box name to be used
for that folder.

   If your spool file is on another host, VM supports accessing spool
files on remote hosts using the POP and IMAP protocols.


File: vm.info,  Node: POP Spool Files,  Next: IMAP Spool Files,  Prev: Spool Files,  Up: Local Folders

POP Spool Files
---------------

VM can access spool files on mail servers via the Post Office Protocol
(POP).  To use a POP mailbox as a spool file, you need to use a POP
maildrop specification (*note maildrop specification::, *note Server
Folders::).  Once this is done, VM will retrieve new mail from the POP
mailbox in the same way as it retrieves it from system mailbox.  The
retrieved messages can be automatically removed from the POP mailbox or
retained until a later expunge operation.

   By default VM will retrieve all the messages from a POP mailbox
before returning control of Emacs to you.  If the mailbox is large, the
wait could be considerable.  If you set `vm-pop-max-message-size' to a
positive numeric value, VM will not automatically retrieve messages
larger than this size.  If VM is retrieving messages because you
invoked `vm-get-new-mail' interactively, then VM will ask whether it
should retrieve the large message.  If VM is retrieving messages
automatically (e.g. `vm-auto-get-new-mail' is set non-`nil') then VM
will skip the large message and you can retrieve it later.

   The variable `vm-pop-messages-per-session' controls how many messages
VM will retrieve from a POP mailbox before returning control to you.
Similarly, the variable `vm-pop-bytes-per-session' limits the number of
bytes VM will retrieve from a POP mailbox before returning control to
you.  By default, the value of both variables is nil, which tells VM to
retrieve all the messages in the POP mailbox regardless of how many
messages there are and how large the mailbox is.

   After VM retrieves messages from the mailbox, the default action is
to delete the messages from there.  If you want VM to leave messages in
the server mailbox until you explicitly request their removal, set
`vm-pop-expunge-after-retrieving' to `nil'.  Messages will not be
removed from the mailbox until you run `vm-expunge-pop-messages'; only
those messages that VM has retrieved into the current folder will be
expunged.

   The variable `vm-pop-auto-expunge-alist' gives you a way to specify
on a per-mailbox basis which POP mailboxes have messages automatically
removed when retrieved and which ones leave the messages on the POP
server.  The value of `vm-pop-auto-expunge-alist' should be a list of
POP mailboxes and values specifying whether messages should be
automatically deleted from the mailbox after retrieval.  The format of
the list is:

     ((MAILDROP . VAL) (MAILDROP . VAL) ...)

   MAILDROP should be an POP mailbox specification as described in the
documentation for the variable `vm-spool-files'.  If you have the POP
password specified in the `vm-spool-files' entry, you do not have to
specify it here as well.  Use `*' instead; VM will still understand
that this mailbox is the same as the one in `vm-spool-files' that
contains the password.

   VAL should be `nil' if retrieved messages should be left in the
corresponding POP mailbox, `t' if retrieved messages should be removed
from the mailbox immediately after retrieval.

   Here is an example:

     (setq vm-pop-auto-expunge-alist
        '(
          ("odin.croc.net:110:pass:kyle:*" . nil)  ;; leave message on the server
          ("hilo.harkie.org:110:pass:kyle:*" . t)  ;; expunge immediately
         )
     )


File: vm.info,  Node: IMAP Spool Files,  Next: Index Files,  Prev: POP Spool Files,  Up: Local Folders

IMAP Spool Files
----------------

VM can also use the IMAP protocol to retrieve mail from a mail server.
As with POP, instead of specifying a local file name in the
`vm-spool-files' definition, you would give an IMAP maildrop
specification (*note maildrop specification::, *note Server Folders::).
Once this is done, VM will retrieve new mail from the IMAP mailbox in
the same way as it retrieves it from system mailbox.  The retrieved
messages can be automatically removed from the IMAP mailbox or retained
until a later expunge operation.

   The variable `vm-imap-messages-per-session' controls how many
messages VM will retrieve from an IMAP mailbox before returning control
to you.  Similarly, the variable `vm-imap-bytes-per-session' limits the
number of bytes VM will retrieve from an IMAP mailbox before returning
control to you.  By default, the value of both variables is nil, which
tells VM to retrieve all the messages in the IMAP mailbox regardless of
how many messages there are and how large the mailbox is.

   After VM retrieves messages from the mailbox, the default action is
to delete the messages from there.  If you want VM to leave messages in
the server mailbox until you explicitly request their removal, set
`vm-imap-expunge-after-retrieving' to `nil'.  Messages will not be
removed from the mailbox until you run `vm-expunge-imap-messages'; only
those messages that VM has retrieved into the current folder will be
expunged.

   The variable `vm-imap-auto-expunge-alist' gives you a way to specify
on a per-mailbox basis which IMAP mailboxes have message automatically
removed when retrieved and which ones leave the messages on the IMAP
server.  The value of `vm-imap-auto-expunge-alist' should be a list of
IMAP mailboxes and values specifying whether messages should be
automatically deleted from the mailbox after retrieval.  The format of
the list is:

     ((MAILDROP . VAL) (MAILDROP . VAL) ...)

   MAILDROP should be an IMAP maildrop specification as described in
the documentation for the variable `vm-spool-files'.  If you have the
IMAP password specified in the `vm-spool-files' entry, you do not have
to specify it here as well.  Use `*' instead; VM will still understand
that this mailbox is the same as the one in `vm-spool-files' that
contains the password.

   VAL should be `nil' if retrieved messages should be left in the
corresponding IMAP mailbox, `t' if retrieved messages should be removed
from the mailbox immediately after retrieval.

   Here is an example:

     (setq vm-imap-auto-expunge-alist
        '(
          ;; leave message on the server
          ("imap:odin.croc.net:143:inbox:login:kyle:*" . nil)
          ;; expunge immediately
          ("imap:hilo.harkie.org:143:inbox:login:kyle:*" . t)
         )
     )

Index Files
-----------

VM can create an index file which describes the messages contained in a
folder.  If such an index file exists and is up to date, then VM will
read the contents of the index file first while starting up in order to
quickly form the summary of the folder.

   To use this feature, set the variable `vm-index-file-suffix' to a
file name extension, e.g.,

     (setq vm-index-file-suffix "idx")


File: vm.info,  Node: Folder types,  Prev: Index Files,  Up: Local Folders

Folder types
------------

VM can handle a variety of formats for mail folders, which differ in
details.  The variable `vm-default-folder-type' can be used to set the
default format that is suitable for your environment.  This setting is
used when VM creates new folders.

   When VM reads a folder from the file system, it examines contents of
the folder to determine what format it is stored in and decodes it
appropriately.  (However, such inference is not fully automatic.  See
below.)

   After a folder is loaded into VM, you can convert it to a different
format using the command `vm-change-folder-type'.  It is a good idea to
keep all your mail folders in a single format in order to avoid
incompatibilities.

   The system default format is referred to as `From_'.  It is the Unix
mbox format described RFC 4155.  In this format, a leading separator
line and a trailing separator line are added to each message.  The
leading separator line starts with the string "From ".  The trailing
separator line is a blank line.  VM actually adds two blank lines at
the end for clarity.

   A variant of this format is referred to as `BellFrom_'.  It has a
leading separator line that starts with the string "From ".  However,
it does not have a trailing blank line.

   Since VM cannot reliably infer whether a mail folder is of type
`From_' or `BellFrom_', you must tell VM which one your system uses by
setting the variable `vm-default-From_-folder-type'.  Some of the old
folders created by VM prior to 2000 were in the `BellFrom_' format.  If
you will be using both `From_' and `BellFrom_' style folders, it is not
possible to choose an appropriate setting for this variable.  It is
recommended that you convert all the old `BellFrom_' folders to the
`From_' format using the command `vm-change-folder-type'.

   Solaris, System V and AIX operating systems use another variant of
the mbox format where the content-length is specified in the "From "
line.  VM refers to this format as `From_-with-Content-Length'.  Since
the content lengths may be unreliable, you must also set the variable
`vm-trust-From_-with-Content-Length' to a non-Nil value in order to
convince VM that you really want to use this format.

   Two additional formats are `mmdf' used by MMDF systems and `babyl'
used by the Emacs Rmail mode.  These formats are recognized
automatically when read from the file system.

1.2 Server Folders
==================

VM supports accessing remote mailboxes on mail servers via the Post
Office Protocol (POP) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).
Instead of a local file name, you can set the `vm-primary-inbox' to a
string that tells VM how to access a server mailbox. Called a "maildrop
specification", the string is of one of the following formats:

     ``pop:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD''
     ``imap:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD''

Remote mailboxes accessed by VM in this fashion are referred to as
"server folders" (and "POP folders" or "IMAP folders", more
specifically).

   VM retrieves mail from the server folders into internal Emacs buffers
for its normal operation.  It also saves copies of the folders on the
local file system for speed of operation.  However, the _only_
permanent copies of the folders are on the mail server.  This should be
contrasted with using server mailboxes as spool files ( *note POP Spool
Files:: and *note IMAP Spool Files::), where the permanent folders are
on the _local_ file system and only incoming mail is held on the
servers.

   Server folders have the advantage that they can be transparently
accessed from multiple locations on the internet.  However, you must
ensure that you have access to enough storage on the mail server to
store all your email.

Maildrop specification
----------------------

The format of a POP or IMAP maildrop specification is as follows:

     ``pop:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD''
     ``imap:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD''

Replace `pop' in the example with `pop-ssl' to have VM speak POP over
an SSL connection.  Use `pop-ssh' to use POP over an SSH connection.
Similarly, replace `imap' with `imap-ssl' or `imap-ssh', as needed.

   For SSL, you must have the stunnel program installed and the
variable `vm-stunnel-program' must name it in order for POP/IMAP over
SSL to work.  The default value of this variable, `"stunnel"', should
be sufficient if the program is installed in your normal command search
path.

   For SSH, you must have the ssh program installed and the variable
`vm-ssh-program' must name it in order for POP/IMAP over SSH to work.
When VM makes the SSH connection it must run a command on the remote
server so that the SSH session is maintained long enough for the
POP/IMAP connection to be established.  By default that command is
`"echo ready; sleep 10"', but you can specify another command by
setting `vm-ssh-remote-command'.  Whatever command you use must produce
some output and hold the connection open long enough for VM to
establish a port-forwarded connection to the mail server.  (SSH must be
able to authenticate without a password, which means you must be using
.shosts authentication or RSA.)

   HOST is the host name of the mail server.

   PORT is the TCP port number to connect to.  The normal port numbers
are:
110            for POP
995            for POP over SSL
143            for IMAP
993            for IMAP over SSL

   MAILBOX is the name of the mailbox on the IMAP server.  This should
be `"inbox"', to access your default IMAP mailbox on the server.  No
MAILBOX component is needed for POP maildrops because POP does not
support multiple mailboxes.

   AUTH is the authentication method used to convince the server you
should have access to the mailbox.  Acceptable values for POP are
`pass', `rpop' and `apop'.  For `pass', the PASSWORD is sent to the
server with the POP PASS command.  For `rpop', the PASSWORD should be
the string to be sent to the server via the RPOP command.  In this case
the string is not really a secret; authentication is done by other
means.  For `apop', an MD5 digest of the PASSWORD appended to the server
time-stamp will be sent to the server with the APOP command.  If Emacs
does not have built in MD5 support, you will have to set the value of
`vm-pop-md5-program' appropriately to point at the program that will
generate the MD5 digest that VM needs.

   Acceptable values of AUTH for IMAP are `"preauth"', `"cram-md5"',
and `"login"'.  `"preauth"' causes VM to skip the authentication stage
of the protocol with the assumption that the session was authenticated
in some way external to VM.  The hook `vm-imap-session-preauth-hook' is
run, and it is expected to return a process connected to an
authenticated IMAP session.  `"cram-md5' tells VM to use the CRAM-MD5
authentication method as specified in RFC 2195.  The advantage of this
method over the `"login"' method is that it avoids sending your
password over the net unencrypted.  Not all IMAP servers support
`"cram-md5"'; if you're not sure, ask your mail administrator or just
try it.  The other value, `"login"', tells VM to use the IMAP LOGIN
command for authentication, which sends your user name and password in
clear text to the server.

   USER is the user name used in authentication methods that require
such an identifier.  `"login"' and `"cram-md5"' use it currently.

   PASSWORD is the secret shared by you and the server for
authentication purposes.  How it is used depends on the value of the
AUTH parameter.  If the PASSWORD is `*', VM will prompt you for the
password the first time you try to retrieve mail from the mailbox.  If
the password is valid, VM will not ask you for the password again
during this Emacs session.

POP Folders
-----------

The command `vm-visit-pop-folder' allows you to visit a POP mailbox as
a folder.  When you visit a POP folder, VM will download copies of the
messages that it finds there for you to read.  These messages are saved
locally in the file system, in the directory specified by
`vm-pop-folder-cache-directory' (or `vm-folder-directory' if the former
is not defined).  If you delete and expunge messages in the folder, the
corresponding messages on the POP server will be removed when you save
the changes with `vm-save-folder'.

   Message attributes (new, replied, filed, etc.) and labels cannot be
stored on the POP server but they will be maintained in the local copy.
This means that if you access the same POP mailbox from multiple
locations on the internet, you will see different attributes at
different locations.  To be able to store message attributes and labels
on the server, you should use IMAP folders (*note IMAP Folders::)
resident on an IMAP server.

   In order for VM to know about POP folders that you can access, you
must declare them by setting the variable `vm-pop-folder-alist'.  The
variable's value should be an associative list of the form:

      ((POPDROP NAME) ...)

   POPDROP is a POP maildrop specification (*note maildrop
specification::).

   NAME is a string that should give a less cumbersome name that you
will use to refer to this maildrop when using `vm-visit-pop-folder'.

   For example:

     (setq vm-pop-folder-alist
           '(
              ("pop:pop.mail.yahoo.com:110:pass:someuser:*" "Yahoo! mail")
              ("pop:localhost:110:pass:someuser:*" "local mail")
            )
     )

   `Yahoo! mail' and `local mail' are what you would type when
`vm-visit-pop-folder' asks for a folder name.  There is no need to
specify the password for POP accounts in this definition.


File: vm.info,  Node: IMAP Folders,  Prev: POP Folders,  Up: Server Folders

IMAP Folders
------------

The command `vm-visit-imap-folder' allows you to visit an IMAP mailbox
as a folder.  The name of the IMAP mailbox should be input via the
minibuffer in the format account-name:folder-name.  Here,
"account-name" is the name of an IMAP account declared in
`vm-imap-account-alist' and "folder-name" is the name of an IMAP
mailbox in this account.

   When you visit an IMAP folder, VM will download copies of the
messages that it finds there for you to read.  These messages are saved
locally in a folder on the disk, in the directory specified by
`vm-imap-folder-cache-directory' (or `vm-folder-directory' if the
former is not defined).  If you delete and expunge messages, these
changes are made to both the local copy of the folder and the folder on
the IMAP server when saved with `vm-save-folder'.

   Message attributes (new, replied, filed, etc.) are stored on the IMAP
server and are also cached locally.  Message labels are also stored on
the IMAP server as user-defined permanent flags.  (This assumes that
the IMAP server has the ability to store user-defined permanent flags.)

   In order for VM to know about IMAP accounts that you can access, you
must declare them by setting the variable `vm-imap-account-alist'.  The
variable's value should be an associative list of the form:

      ((IMAPDROP NAME) ...)

   IMAPDROP is an IMAP maildrop specification (*note maildrop
specification::).

   NAME is a string that should give a less cumbersome name that you
will use to refer to this maildrop when using `vm-visit-imap-folder'.
For example:

     (setq vm-imap-account-alist
           '(
             ("imap-ssl:mail.foocorp.com:993:*:login:becky:*" "becky")
             ("imap:crickle.lex.ky.us:143:*:login:becky:*" "crickle")
            )
     )

The mailbox and password fields (`*' in the example) are ignored.  When
`vm-visit-imap-folder' asks for a folder name, you enter an account
name followed by ":" and a folder name.  Any folder that is accessible
to you on the IMAP server can be specified.  For example, `becky:inbox'
or `crickle:drafts'.

   The customization variable `vm-imap-server-list', used in older
versions of VM, is deprecated.  Please use `vm-imap-account-alist'
instead.

IMAP Synchronization
--------------------

The local copy and the folder on the IMAP server are partially
synchronized every time `vm-get-new-mail' is invoked.  This involves
(i) writing the changed attributes and labels to the server, (ii)
updating the attributes and labels in the local copy based on the
server data, (iii) expunging messages in the local copy that have been
expunged on the server (through perhaps a concurrent access to the IMAP
folder), and finally, (iv) retrieving any new messages on the server.
The variable `vm-imap-sync-on-get' specifies whether such
synchronization should be done as part of `vm-get-new-mail'.  If the
variable is set to nil then `vm-get-new-mail' simply retrieves any new
messages.

   The local copy and the folder on the IMAP server are also
synchronized every time `vm-save-folder' is invoked.  This involves (i)
writing the changed attributes and labels to the server, (ii) updating
the attributes and labels in the local copy based on the server data,
(iii) expunging messages in the local copy that have been expunged on
the server (through perhaps a concurrent access to the IMAP folder),
(iv) deleting the locally expunged messages on the server, and finally,
(v) saving a copy of the folder on the file system.

   The command `vm-imap-synchronize' can always be used to perform full
synchronization with the server.

   After fetching messages from the IMAP server into the local copy, it
is possible to visit the local copy as if it were a normal folder.  VM
can operate on the local copy without contacting the server.  This
allows offline operation on the mail folders.  When the IMAP server is
connected again, one should do the `vm-imap-synchronize' command with a
prefix argument.  This causes _all_ the message attributes and labels
to be written to the server, since it may not be known which of them
have actually changed during the offline operation.

1.3 Getting New Mail
====================

Pressing `g' runs `vm-get-new-mail', which will retrieve mail from all
the spool files associated with the current folder.  *Note Local
Folders::.  For POP folders, any newly arrived messages at the POP
server will be incorporated into the local copy of the POP folder.

   If the value of the variable `vm-auto-get-new-mail' is non-`nil' VM
will retrieve mail for a folder whenever the folder is visited.  If the
value is a positive integer N, VM will also check for new mail every N
seconds for all folders currently being visited.  If new mail is
present, VM will retrieve it.

   If the value of the variable `vm-mail-check-interval' is a positive
integer N, VM will check for new mail every N seconds, but instead of
retrieving mail, the word "Mail" will appear on the Emacs mode line of
folders that have mail waiting.


File: vm.info,  Node: Crash Recovery,  Prev: Getting New Mail,  Up: Starting Up

1.4 Crash Recovery
==================

When Emacs crashes, its last action before dying is to try to write out
an autosave file that contains changes to files that you were editing.
VM folders are file buffers inside Emacs, so folders are autosaved
also.  Changes, with regard to VM folders, means attribute changes,
label additions and deletions, message edits, and expunges.  VM keeps
track of whether a message is new or old, whether it has been replied
to, whether it is flagged for deletion and so on, by writing special
headers into the folder buffer.  These headers are saved to disk when
you save the folder.  If Emacs crashes before the folder has been saved,
VM may forget some attribute changes unless they were written to the
autosave file.

   Note that when VM retrieves mail from spool files it _always_ writes
them to disk immediately and at least one copy of the message is on
disk at all times.  So while you can lose attribute changes from
crashes, you should not lose messages unless the disk itself is
compromised.

   When you visit a folder, VM checks for the existence of an autosave
file that has been modified more recently than the folder file.  If
such an autosave file exists, there is a good chance that Emacs or your
operating system crashed while VM was visiting a folder.  VM will then
write a message to the echo area informing you of the existence of the
autosave file and visit the folder in read-only mode.  Visiting the
folder in read-only mode prevents you from modifying the folder, which
in turn prevents Emacs from wanting to write new changes to the
autosave file.  VM will not retrieve new mail for a folder that is in
read-only mode.  VM also skips summary generation and MIME decoding to
help catch your attention.

   If you want to recover the lost changes, run `M-x vm-recover-folder'
or use the Recover Folder entry in Folder menu.  At the `Recover File:
' prompt press `RET'.  (Emacs's built-in `recover-file' command is not
recommended for this purpose because VM is unable to obtain reliable
data regarding the mail folders from Emacs.)  Emacs will then display a
detailed directory listing showing the folder file and the autosave
file and ask if you want to recover from the autosave file.  A good
rule of thumb is to answer "yes" if the autosave file is larger than
the folder file.  If the autosave file is significantly smaller, Emacs
may not have completed writing the autosave file.  Or it could be that
the smaller autosave file reflects the results of an expunge that you
had not yet committed to disk before the crash.  If so, answering "no"
means you might have to do that expunge again, but this is better than
not knowing whether the autosave file was truncated.

   Assuming you answered "yes", the folder buffer's contents will be
replaced by the contents of the autosave file and VM will re-parse the
folder.  At this point the contents of the folder buffer and the disk
copy of the folder are different.  Therefore VM will not get new mail
for this folder until the two copies of the folder are synchronized.
When you are satisfied that the recovered folder is whole and intact,
type `S' to save it to disk.  After you do this, VM will allow you to
use `g' to retrieve any new mail that has arrived in the spool files
for the folder.

   Assuming you answered "no" to the recovery question, you should type
`C-x C-q', which is bound to `vm-toggle-read-only' in VM folder
buffers.  The folder will be taken out of read-only mode and you can
read and retrieve your mail normally.

   If you have made changes to a mail folder which you would like to
cancel and go back to the version currently on the disk, you can use
the function `vm-revert-folder' or the Revert Folder entry in the
Folder menu.  (Emacs's built-in `revert-file' is not recommended.)

2 Selecting Messages
********************

In order to read, delete, or do anything to a message, you need to
select it.  In other words, make the message the "current message".

   The primary commands for selecting messages in VM are `n'
(`vm-next-message') and `p' (`vm-previous-message').  These commands
move forward and backward through the current folder.  By default,
these commands skip messages flagged for deletion.  This behavior can be
disabled by setting the value of the variable
`vm-skip-deleted-messages' to `nil'.  These commands can also be made
to skip messages that have been read; set `vm-skip-read-messages' to
`t' to do this.

   The commands `n' and `p' also take prefix arguments that specify the
number of messages to move forward or backward.  If the magnitude of
the prefix argument is greater than 1, no message skipping will be done
regardless of the settings of the skip variables.

   The variable `vm-circular-folders' determines whether VM folders
will be considered circular by various commands.  "Circular" means VM
will wrap from the end of the folder to the start and vice versa when
moving the message pointer, deleting, undeleting or saving messages
before or after the current message.

   A value of `t' causes all VM commands to consider folders circular.
A value of `nil' causes all VM commands to signal an error if the start
or end of the folder would have to be passed to complete the command.
For movement commands, this occurs after the message pointer has been
moved as far as it can go.  For other commands the error occurs before
any part of the command has been executed, i.e. no deletions, saves,
etc. will be done unless they can be done in their entirety.  A value
other than `nil' or `t' causes only VM's movement commands to consider
folders circular.  Saves, deletes and undeletes will behave as if the
value is `nil'.  The default value of `vm-circular-folders' is `nil'.

   You can also select messages by using the summary window.  *Note
Summaries::.  Move the cursor to the summary line for the message you
want to select and press `RET'.  VM will select this message.  Instead
of pressing `RET' you could run some other VM command that operates
based on the notion of a `current message'.  VM will select the message
under the cursor in the summary window before executing such commands.
Example, if you type `d', VM will select the message under the cursor
and then delete it.  Note that this occurs _only_ when you execute a
command when the cursor is in the summary buffer window and only if the
variable `vm-follow-summary-cursor' is non-`nil'.

   When a folder is visited or when you type `g' and VM retrieves some
mail, the default action is to move to the first new or unread message
in the folder.  New messages are favored over old but unread messages.
If you set `vm-jump-to-new-messages' to `nil', VM will favor old,
unread messages over new messages if the old, unread message appears
earlier in the folder.  If you set `vm-jump-to-unread-messages' to
`nil' also, VM will not search for new or unread messages.

   Other commands to select messages:

`RET (`vm-goto-message')'
     Go to message number N.  N is the prefix argument, if provided,
     otherwise it is prompted for in the minibuffer.  

`TAB (`vm-goto-message-last-seen')'
     Go to message last previewed or read.  

`N (`vm-next-message-no-skip')'
`P (`vm-previous-message-no-skip')'
     Go to the next (previous) message, ignoring the settings of the
     skip control variables.  

`M-n (`vm-next-unread-message')'
`M-p (`vm-previous-unread-message')'
     Move forward (backward) to the nearest new or unread message.  

`M-s (`vm-isearch-forward')'

`M-x vm-isearch-backward'
     These work just like Emacs' normal forward and backward incremental
     search commands, except that when the search ends, VM selects the
     message containing point.  If the value of the variable
     `vm-search-using-regexps' is non-`nil', a regular expression may
     be used instead of a fixed string for the search pattern; VM
     defaults to the fixed string search.  If a prefix argument is
     given, the value of `vm-search-using-regexps' is temporarily
     reversed for the search.  *Note Incremental Search:
     (emacs)Incremental Search.

3 Reading Messages
******************

Once a message has been selected, VM will show it to you.  By default,
presentation is done in two stages: "previewing" and "paging".

* Menu:

* Previewing::                  Customizing message previews.
* Viewing::                     Viewing the current message.
* MIME Messages::               Using VM's MIME display features.


File: vm.info,  Node: Previewing,  Next: Viewing,  Prev: Reading Messages,  Up: Reading Messages

3.1 Previewing
==============

"Previewing" means showing you a small portion of a message and
allowing you to decide whether you want to read it.  Typing <SPC>
exposes the body of the message, and from there you can repeatedly type
<SPC> to page through the message.

   By default, the sender, recipient, subject and date headers are shown
when previewing; the rest of the message is hidden.  This behavior may
be altered by changing the settings of three variables:
`vm-visible-headers', `vm-invisible-header-regexp' and
`vm-preview-lines'.

   If the value of `vm-preview-lines' is a number, it tells VM how many
lines of the text of the message should be visible.  The default value
of this variable is 0.  If `vm-preview-lines' is `nil', then previewing
is not done at all; when a message is first presented it is immediately
exposed in its entirety and is flagged as read.  If `vm-preview-lines'
is `t', the message body is displayed fully but the message is not
flagged as read until you type <SPC>.

   The value of `vm-visible-headers' should be a list of regular
expressions matching the beginnings of headers that should be made
visible when a message is presented.  The regexps should be listed in
the preferred presentation order of the headers they match.

   If non-`nil', the variable `vm-invisible-header-regexp' specifies
what headers should _not_ be displayed.  Its value should be a string
containing a regular expression that matches all headers you do not
want to see.  Setting this variable non-`nil' implies that you want to
see all headers not matched by it; therefore the value of
`vm-visible-headers' is only used to determine the order of the visible
headers in this case.  Headers not matched by
`vm-invisible-header-regexp' or `vm-visible-headers' are displayed last.

   If you change the value of either `vm-visible-headers' or
`vm-invisible-header-regexp' in the middle of a VM session the effects
will not be immediate.  You will need to use the command
`vm-discard-cached-data' on each message (bound to `j' by default) to
force VM to rearrange the message headers.  A good way to do this is to
mark all the messages in the folder and apply `vm-discard-cached-data'
to the marked messages *Note Marking Messages::.

   Another variable of interest is `vm-highlighted-header-regexp'.  The
value of this variable should be a single regular expression that
matches the beginnings of any header that should be presented in inverse
video when previewing.  For example, a value of `"^From\\|^Subject"'
causes the From and Subject headers to be highlighted.  Highlighted
headers will be displayed using the face specified by
`vm-highlighted-header-face', which defaults to 'bold.

   By default, VM will not preview messages that are flagged as read.
To have VM preview all messages, set the value of
`vm-preview-read-messages' to `t'.

   Typing `t' (`vm-expose-hidden-headers') makes VM toggle between
exposing and hiding headers that would ordinarily be hidden.


File: vm.info,  Node: Viewing,  Next: MIME Messages,  Prev: Previewing,  Up: Reading Messages

3.2 Viewing
===========

Typing <SPC> during a message preview exposes the body of the message.
If the message was new or previously unread, it will be flagged "read".
At this point you can use <SPC> to scroll forward, and `b' or <DEL> to
scroll backward a windowful of text at a time.  A prefix argument N
applied to these commands causes VM to scroll forward or backward N
lines.  Typing space at the end of a message moves you to the next
message.  If the value of `vm-auto-next-message' is `nil', <SPC> will
not move to the next message; you must type `n' explicitly.

   If the value of `vm-honor-page-delimiters' is non-`nil', VM will
recognize and honor page delimiters.  This means that when you scroll
through a document, VM will display text only up to the next page
delimiter.  Text after the delimiter will be hidden until you type
another <SPC>, at which point the text preceding the delimiter will
become hidden.  The Emacs variable `page-delimiter' determines what VM
will consider to be a page delimiter.

   You can "unread" a message (so to speak) by typing `U'
(`vm-unread-message').  The current message will be flagged unread.

   Sometimes you will receive messages that contain lines that are too
long to fit on your screen without wrapping.  Setting
`vm-word-wrap-paragraphs' to t will cause VM to use the `longlines.el'
library by Grossjohann, Schroeder and Yidong to carry out word
wrapping.  You must have this library installed somewhere on your
`load-path'.  Another way to deal with the problem is to use the
`visual-line-mode' in Emacs 23.  You can activate it automatically for
viewing messages by adding the function `turn-on-visual-line-mode' to
the `vm-presentation-mode-hook'.

   If you are unable to use either of these solutions, then you can use
Emacs's paragraph filling facility.  If you set
`vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' to a positive numeric value
N, VM will call `fill-paragraph' on all paragraphs that contain lines
spanning N columns or more.  As with other things VM does that modifies
the way the message looks on the screen, this does not change message
contents.  VM copies the message contents to a "presentation" buffer
before altering them.  The fill column that VM uses is controlled by
`vm-paragraph-fill-column'.  Unlike the Emacs variable `fill-column',
this variable is not buffer-local by default.


File: vm.info,  Node: MIME Messages,  Prev: Viewing,  Up: Reading Messages

3.3 Reading MIME Messages
=========================

"MIME" is a set of extensions to the standard Internet message format
that allows reliable transmission of arbitrary data including images,
audio and video, as well as ordinary text in different languages.  By
default, VM will recognize MIME encoded messages and display them as
specified by the various MIME standards specifications.  This can be
turned off by setting the variable `vm-display-using-mime' to `nil' and
VM will then display MIME messages as plain text messages.

   At its most basic MIME is a set of transfer encodings used to ensure
error free transport, and a set of content types.  VM understands the
two standard MIME transport encodings, Quoted-Printable and BASE64, and
will decode messages that use them as necessary.  VM also will try to
recognize and decode messages using the UNIX "uuencode" encoding
system.  While this is not an official MIME transfer encoding and never
will be, enough old mailers still use it that it is worthwhile to
attempt to decode it.  VM has Emacs-Lisp based Quoted-Printable and
BASE64 encoders and decoders, but you can have VM use external programs
to perform these tasks and the process will almost certainly be faster.
The variables `vm-mime-qp-decoder-program',
`vm-mime-qp-decoder-switches', `vm-mime-qp-encoder-program',

`vm-mime-base64-encoder-switches', `vm-mime-base64-decoder-program',
`vm-mime-base64-encoder-program', tell VM which programs to use and

VM's distribution sites on the Internet to handle BASE64 and
Quoted-Printable.  VM does not have a built-in "uuencode" decoder, so
`vm-mime-uuencode-decoder-program' must be set non-`nil' for VM to
decode uuencoded MIME objects.

Viewing MIME messages
---------------------

By default VM will display as many content types as possible within
Emacs.  Images and audio are also supported if support for images and
audio has been compiled in.  Types that cannot be displayed internally
within Emacs can be converted to a type that can, or be displayed using
an external viewer.

   The first step in displaying a MIME message is decoding it to
determine what object types it contains.  The variable
`vm-auto-decode-mime-messages' controls when this happens.  A value of
`t' means VM should decode the message as soon as the message body is
exposed, or during previewing if `vm-mime-decode-for-preview' is also
set non-`nil'.  A `nil' value means wait until decoding is explicitly
requested.  Type `D' (`vm-decode-mime-message') to manually initiate
MIME decoding.

   When VM does not display a MIME object immediately, it displays a
button or tag line in its place that describes the object and what you
have to do to display it.  The value of `vm-mime-button-format-alist'
determines the format of the text in those buttons.


File: vm.info,  Node: Attachments,  Next: Internal display,  Prev: Viewing MIME,  Up: MIME Messages

Operating on MIME attachments
-----------------------------

After decoding you will see either the decoded MIME objects or button
lines that must be activated to attempt display of the MIME object.

   The variable `vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types' specifies the
types that are displayed immediately.  Its value should be a list of
MIME content types that should be displayed immediately after decoding.
Other types will be displayed as a button that you must activate to
display the object.

   To activate a button, either click the middle mouse button over it,
or move the cursor to the line and press RET.  If you are running under
a window system, you can use the right mouse button over a MIME button
to display a menu of actions you can take on the MIME object.  If you
prefer using keyboard commands, you can save the MIME object with `$
w', print it with `$ p', or pipe it to a shell command with `$ |'.  Use
`$ s' to append an encapsulated message or USENET news article to a
folder.  If you want to display the object with its characters
displayed using Emacs' default face, use `$ RET'.  To display the
object using an external viewer, type `$ e'.

$ w            `vm-mime-reader-map-save-file'
$ s            `vm-mime-reader-map-save-message'
$ p            `vm-mime-reader-map-pipe-to-printer'
$ |            `vm-mime-reader-map-pipe-to-command'
$ RET          `vm-mime-reader-map-display-using-default'
$ e            `vm-mime-reader-map-display-using-external-viewer'
$ v            `vm-mime-reader-map-display-object-as-type'
$ d            `vm-delete-mime-object'
$ a            `vm-mime-attach-object-from-message'

   The MIME attachments can be saved to disk with `$ w'
(`vm-mime-reader-map-save-file').  They can be deleted at the same time
by setting the variable `vm-mime-delete-after-saving'.  In this case,
the attachment is deleted and replaced by a MIME part that refers to
the saved copy.  The variable `vm-mime-attachment-save-directory'
specifies the default directory to save the attachments in.  The MIME
attachments can also be deleted directly from the message bodies with
`$ d' (`vm-delete-mime-object').  The variable `vm-mime-confirm-delete'
controls whether a confirmation is asked for.

   It is a good idea to use `vm-mime-delete-after-saving' to delete
saved attachments instead of deleting them manually, because with the
former approach the message will have a handle to the saved copy, which
can be retrieved when desired.

   Saving attachments to the file system and deleting them from message
bodies has the beneficial effect of reducing the size of VM folders.
That leads to a better utilization of the computer resources and
usually a faster operation of VM.

   The commands `vm-mime-save-all-attachments' and
`vm-mime-delete-all-attachments' can be used to save or delete all the
attachments in a message.  An "attachment" in this context is any MIME
part that has "attachment" as its content-disposition or simply has a
file name.  In addition, all MIME parts that have types matching
`vm-mime-savable-types' or `vm-mime-deletable-types' (but not the
corresponding `-exceptions') are included.

Internal display of MIME attachments
------------------------------------

A value of t for `vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types' means that all
types should be displayed immediately.  A nil value means never display
MIME objects immediately; only use buttons.  If the value of
`vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types' is a list, it should be a list
of strings, which should all be MIME types or type/subtype pairs.
Example:

     (setq vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types '("text" "image/jpeg"))

If a top-level type is listed without a subtype, all subtypes of that
type are assumed to be included.  The example above specifies that all
text types are displayed immediately, but only JPEG images are
displayed this way.

   The variable `vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-type-exceptions' should
be a list of MIME content types that should not be displayed
immediately after decoding.  This variable acts as an exception list
for `vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types'; all types listed there will
be auto-displayed except those in the exception list.

   The value of `vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-type-exceptions' should
be either nil or a list of strings.  The strings should all be types or
type/subtype pairs.  Example:

     (setq vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-type-exceptions '("text/html"))

Again, if a top-level type is listed without a subtype, all subtypes of
that type are assumed to be included.

   The variable `vm-mime-internal-content-types' specifies which types
should be displayed internally within Emacs.  Like
`vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types' its value should be a list of
MIME content types.  A value of t means that VM should always display
an object internally if possible.  VM knows which object types can be
displayed internally, so you can specify the types you want without
worrying about errors if Emacs can't handle them.  A `nil' value means
never display MIME objects internally, which means VM will have to run
an external viewer to display all MIME objects.

   If the value is a list, it should be a list of strings.  Example:

     (setq vm-mime-internal-content-types '("text" "message" "image/jpeg"))

If a top-level type is listed without a subtype, all subtypes of that
type are assumed to be included.  Note that multipart types are always
handled internally regardless of the setting of this variable.

   The variable `vm-mime-internal-content-type-exceptions' serves as
the exception list for `vm-mime-internal-content-types'.  Its value
should be a list of types that should not be displayed internally.

   The HTML content in text/html MIME parts can be displayed in Emacs
using a variety of packages.  VM knows about:

lynx        The lynx browser used externally to convert HTML to plain
            text
w3m         The w3m browser used externally to convert HTML to plain text
emacs-w3    The Emacs/W3 browser used internally in Emacs
emacs-w3m   The Emacs/W3M browser used internally in Emacs

   You can set the variable `vm-mime-text/html-handler' to one of these
values to use the appropriate package.  A value of `auto-select' causes
VM to select the best package available.  A value of `nil' asks VM not
to display HTML content internally.


File: vm.info,  Node: External display,  Next: Displaying images,  Prev: Internal display,  Up: MIME Messages

External display of MIME attachments
------------------------------------

For types that you want displayed externally, set the value of
`vm-mime-external-content-types-alist' to specify external viewers for
the types.  The value of this variable should be an associative list of
MIME content types and the external programs used to display them.  If
VM cannot display a type internally or a type is not listed in
`vm-mime-internal-content-types' VM will try to launch an external
program to display that type.

   The alist format is a list of lists, each sublist having the form

     (TYPE PROGRAM ARG ARG ... )

or

     (TYPE COMMAND-LINE)

TYPE is a string specifying a MIME type or type/subtype pair.  For
example "text" or "image/jpeg".  If a top-level type is listed without
a subtype, all subtypes of that type are assumed to be included.

   In the first form, PROGRAM is a string naming a program to run to
display an object.  Any ARGs will be passed to the program as
arguments.  The octets that compose the object will be written into a
temporary file and the name of the file can be inserted into an ARG
string by writing `%f' in the ARG string.  In earlier versions of VM
the filename was always added as the last argument; as of VM 6.49 this
is only done if `%f' does not appear in any of the ARG strings.

   If the COMMAND-LINE form is used, the program and its arguments are
specified as a single string and that string is passed to the shell
("sh -c" typically) for execution.  Since the command line will be
passed to the shell, you can use shell variables and input/output
redirection if needed.  As with the PROGRAM/ARGS form, the name of the
temporary file that contains the MIME object will be appended to the
command line if `%f' does not appear in the command line string.

   In either the PROGRAM/ARG or COMMAND-LINE forms, all the program and
argument strings will have any %-specifiers in them expanded as
described in the documentation for the variable
`vm-mime-button-format-alist'.  The only difference is that `%f' refers
to the temporary file VM creates to store the object to be displayed,
not the filename that the sender may have associated with the
attachment.

   Example:

     (setq vm-mime-external-content-types-alist
           '(
              ("text/html"   "netscape")
              ("image/gif"   "xv")
              ("image/jpeg"  "xv")
              ("video/mpeg"  "mpeg_play")
              ("video"       "xanim")
            )
     )

   The first matching list element will be used.

   No multipart message will ever be sent to an external viewer.

   External viewer processes are normally killed when you select a new
message in the current folder.  If you want viewer processes to not be
killed, set `vm-mime-delete-viewer-processes' to a `nil' value.

   Any type that cannot be displayed internally or externally or
converted to a type that can be displayed, will be displayed as a
button that allows you to save the body to a file.

   As with the internal type list, there is an exception list that you
can use to specify types that you do not want displayed externally.
When VM is considering whether it should automatically launch an
external viewer, it will consult the variable
`vm-mime-external-content-type-exceptions'.  If the type to be
displayed is listed, VM will not launch a viewer.  This allows you to
setup viewers for types that ordinarily you would not want VM to
display or for types that you normally want to convert to some other
type using `vm-mime-type-converter-alist'.  You can still display such
a type with an external viewer by using `$ e'.

   When a MIME object is displayed using an external viewer VM must
first write the object to a temporary file.  The external viewer then
opens and displays that file.  Some viewers will not open a file unless
the filename ends with some extension that it recognizes such as
`.html' or `.jpg'.  You can use the variable
`vm-mime-attachment-auto-suffix-alist' to map MIME types to extensions
that your external viewers will recognize.  The value of this variable
should be a list of type and suffix pairs.  The list format is:

     ((TYPE . SUFFIX) ...)

   TYPE is a string specifying a MIME top-level type or a type/subtype
pair.  If a top-level type is listed without a subtype, all subtypes of
that type are matched.

   SUFFIX is a string specifying the suffix that should be used for the
accompanying type.

   Example:

     (setq vm-mime-attachment-auto-suffix-alist
           '(
             ("image/jpeg"           .       ".jpg")
             ("image/gif"            .       ".gif")
             ("image/png"            .       ".png")
             ("text"                 .       ".txt")
            )
     )

VM will search the list for a matching type.  The suffix associated
with the first type that matches will be used for the temporary
filename.

Displaying inline images in messages
------------------------------------

Most versions of Emacs can display images when used on graphical
screens.  You can verify if the Emacs version is able to do so by
calling the function `display-images-p'.  However, Emacs relies on
external libraries to create graphical images, which are specified
through the variable `image-library-alist'.  Even if Emacs has the
ability to display some image type, it cannot display such images
unless appropriate libraries are installed and specified to Emacs.  You
can verify which image types are really available by calling the
function `image-type-available-p' with an image type such as `tiff' or
`gif' as the argument.

   Assuming that a particular image type, say `tiff' is available, you
can include its MIME type in `vm-mime-internal-content-types', e.g.,
     (add-to-list 'vm-mime-internal-content-types "image/tiff")
   You can also add the MIME type to the variable
`vm-auto-displayed-mime-content-types' so that VM will automatically
display all images of the type.  If the type is not included among the
auto-displayed types, then the image is initially shown as a button
with a thumbnail image.  Clicking on the button with the middle mouse
button expands the image to its full size.

   Once an image is displayed, you can use the right mouse button to do
various image manipulations on it, such as enlarging/reducing it,
rotating it etc.  To do such operations, VM uses the ImageMagick
graphics manipulation software.  You can install ImageMagick on your
system and specify the location of its `identify' and `convert'
programs to VM via the variables `vm-imagemagick-identify-program' and
`vm-imagemagick-convert-program'.

   By default, VM displays images by slicing them into contiguous
horizontal strips and displaying the strips in order.  This facilitates
vertical scrolling within an image.  The variable
`vm-mime-use-image-strips' controls whether VM uses strips for image
display.  It is `t' by default.

   VM also uses the ImageMagick's `convert' program to convert between
image formats, so that an image that is not displayable in Emacs is
converted to another format that is displayable.  You can turn off such
conversion by setting the variable `vm-imagemagick-convert-program' to
`nil'.


File: vm.info,  Node: MIME type conversion,  Next: Character sets,  Prev: Displaying images,  Up: MIME Messages

MIME type conversion
--------------------

Types that cannot be displayed internally or externally are checked
against an associative list of types that can be converted to other
types.  If an object can be converted to a type that VM can display,
then the conversion is done and the new object is subject to the
auto-display rules which determine whether the object is displayed
immediately or a button is displayed in its place.  The conversion list
is stored in the variable `vm-mime-type-converter-alist'.

   The alist format is

     ( (START-TYPE END-TYPE COMMAND-LINE ) ... )

   START-TYPE is a string specifying a MIME type or type/subtype pair.
Example `"text"' or `"image/jpeg"'.  If a top-level type is listed
without a subtype, all subtypes of that type are assumed to be included.

   END-TYPE must be an exact type/subtype pair.  This is the type to
which START-TYPE will be converted.

   COMMAND-LINE is a string giving a command line to be passed to the
shell.  The octets that compose the object will be written to the
standard input of the shell command.

   Example:

     (setq vm-mime-type-converter-alist
            '(
              ("image/jpeg"  "image/gif"     "jpeg2gif")
              ("text/html"   "text/plain"    "striptags")
             )
     )

The first matching list element will be used.


File: vm.info,  Node: Character sets,  Next: multipart/alternative,  Prev: MIME type conversion,  Up: MIME Messages

MIME character sets
-------------------

For text type messages, MIME also requires that a character set be
specified, so that the recipient's mail reader knows what character
glyphs to use to display each character code.  To display a message
properly VM needs to know how to choose a font for a given character
set.

   The variable `vm-mime-default-face-charsets' tells VM what character
sets your default face can display.  For most American and European
users using X Windows, Emacs' default face displays the ISO-8859-1 and
US-ASCII characters, US-ASCII being a subset of ISO-8859-1.  The value
of `vm-mime-default-face-charsets' must be a list of strings specifying
the character sets that your default face can display.  This variable
is useful for making bogus, unregistered character sets that are slight
variants of ISO-8859-1 visible.  Example:

     (add-to-list 'vm-mime-default-face-charsets "Windows-1251")
     (add-to-list 'vm-mime-default-face-charsets "Windows-1252")
     (add-to-list 'vm-mime-default-face-charsets "Windows-1257")

Messages sent using such character sets would normally be considered
undisplayable by VM, and a button would be displayed that offers to
save the message body to a file.

   Please note that for character sets listed in this variable, VM's
MIME decoding is bypassed.  So don't add charsets like \"utf-8\" that
require additional decoding.

   Sometimes a charset that VM cannot display can be converted to a one
that VM can display.  An example would be a message encoded using UTF-8
but in fact only contains Japanese characters.  In that case the
message text could probably be converted to iso-2022-jp which VM
running on a MULE-enabled Emacs could display.

   VM offers a way to do such conversions.  The variable
`vm-mime-charset-converter-alist' is an associative list of MIME
charsets and programs that can convert between them.  If VM cannot
display a particular character set, it will scan this list to see if
the charset can be converted into a charset that it can display.

   The alist format is:

      ( ( START-CHARSET END-CHARSET COMMAND-LINE ) ... )

   START-CHARSET is a string specifying a MIME charset.  Example
`"iso-8859-1"' or `"utf-8"'.

   END-CHARSET is a string specifying the charset to which
START-CHARSET will be converted.

   COMMAND-LINE is a string giving a command line to be passed to the
shell.  The characters in START-CHARSET will be written to the standard
input of the shell command and VM expects characters encoded in
END-CHARSET to appear at the standard output of the COMMAND-LINE.
COMMAND-LINE is passed to the shell, so you can use pipelines, shell
variables and redirections.

   Example:

     (setq vm-mime-charset-converter-alist
           '(
              ("utf-8" "iso-2022-jp" "iconv -f utf-8 -t iso-2022-jp")
            )
     )

   The first matching list element will be used.

   The variable `vm-mime-charset-font-alist' tells VM what font to use
to display a character set that cannot be displayed using the default
face.  The value of this variable should be an assoc list of character
sets and fonts that can be used to display them.  The format of the
list is:

   ( (CHARSET . FONT) ...)

   CHARSET is a string naming a MIME registered character set such as
`"iso-8859-5"'.

   FONT is a string naming a font that can be used to display CHARSET.

   An example setup might be:

     (setq vm-mime-charset-font-alist
       '(
         ("iso-8859-5" . "-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-160-72-72-c-80-iso8859-5")
        )
     )

This variable is only useful for character sets whose characters can
all be encoded in single 8-bit bytes.  Also multiple fonts can only be
displayed if you're running under a window system e.g. X Windows.  So
this variable will have no effect if you're running Emacs on a tty.

   Note that under FSF Emacs 19 any fonts you use must be the same
height as your default font.  XEmacs and Emacs 21 do not have this
limitation.  Under Emacs 20 and beyond, and under any XEmacs version
compiled with MULE support, the value of `vm-mime-charset-font-alist'
has no effect.  This is because all characters are displayed using
fonts discovered by MULE and VM has no control over them.


File: vm.info,  Node: multipart/alternative,  Next: Bad MIME,  Prev: Character sets,  Up: MIME Messages

MIME multipart/alternative
--------------------------

MIME allows a message to be sent with its content encoded in multiple
formats, simultaneously, in the same message.  Such messages have a
content type of multipart/alternative.  The idea is that the sender
might have different MIME decoding or display capabilities than some of
his recipients.  For instance, the sender may be able to compose a
message using fancy text formatting constructs like tables, italics and
equations but some of the recipients may only be able to display plain
text.  The multipart/alternative type message is the solution to this
dilemma.  Such a message would contain at least two text subparts, one
in plain text and the other in the full featured text formatting
language that the sender used.

   To control how VM displays multipart/alternative messages, you must
set the variable `vm-mime-alternative-select-method'.  Its value must be
a symbol.  A value of `best' tells VM to display the message using the
subpart closest in appearance to what the sender used to compose the
message.  In the example above this would mean displaying the fully
featured text subpart, if VM knows how to display that type.  VM will
display the type either internally or externally.  A value of
`best-internal' tells VM to use the closest subpart that it can display
internally.  External viewers won't be used in this case.  A value of
`all' asks VM to display all the alternatives.

   The value can also be a list of the form
       (favorite TYPE ...)
   with the first element of the list being the symbol `favorite'.  The
remaining elements of the list are strings specifying MIME types.  VM
will look for each TYPE in turn in the list of alternatives and choose
the first matching alternative found that can be displayed.  If instead
of the symbol `favorite', `favorite-internal' is used then the first
TYPE that matches an alternative that can be displayed internally will
be chosen.

   Messages with multiple alternatives use up extra file space and slow
down the operation of vm.  If you would like keep the text/plain
alternatives but erase the text/html alternatives, you can use the
'vm-mime-nuke-alternative-text/html' command.


File: vm.info,  Node: Bad MIME,  Prev: multipart/alternative,  Up: MIME Messages

Dealing with bad MIME
---------------------

Some mailers incorrectly use the generic `application/octet-stream'
type when sending files that really have a specific MIME type.  For
example, a JPEG image might be sent using `application/octet-stream'
type instead of `image/jpeg', which would be the correct type.  In many
cases the filename sent along with the mistyped file (e.g. `foo.jpg')
suggests the correct type.  If the variable `vm-infer-mime-types' is
set non-`nil', VM will attempt to use the filename sent with a MIME
attachment to guess an attachment's type if the attachment is of type
`application/octet-stream'.

4 Sending Messages
******************

When sending messages from within VM, you will be using the standard
Mail major mode provided with GNU Emacs, plus some extensions added by
VM.  *Note Mail Mode: (emacs)Mail Mode.  However, mail composition
buffers created by VM have some extra command keys.

`C-c C-y (`vm-yank-message')'
     Copies a message from the folder that is the parent of this
     composition into the mail composition buffer.  The message number
     is read from the minibuffer.  By default, each line of the copy is
     prepended with the value of the variable
     `vm-included-text-prefix'.  All message headers are yanked along
     with the text.  Point is left before the inserted text, the mark
     after.  Any hook functions bound to `mail-yank-hooks' are run,
     after inserting the text and setting point and mark.  If a prefix
     argument is given, this tells VM to ignore `mail-yank-hooks',
     don't set the mark, don't prepend the value of
     `vm-included-text-prefix' to every yanked line, and don't yank any
     headers other than those specified in `vm-visible-headers' and
     `vm-invisible-headers'.

``M-x vm-yank-message-other-folder''
     This allows one to yank a message from a different folder than the
     parent of this composition.

`C-c C-v <Any VM command key>'
     All VM commands may be accessed in a VM Mail mode buffer by
     prefixing them with C-c C-v.  

`C-c C-a (`vm-mime-attach-file')'
     Attaches a file to the composition.  When you send the message, VM
     will insert the file and MIME encode it.  The variable
     `vm-send-using-mime' must be set non-`nil' for this command to
     work.  You will be asked for the file's type, and a brief
     description of the attachment.  The description is optional.  If
     the file's type is a text type, you will also be asked for the
     character set in which the text should be displayed.  The new
     attachment will appear as a highlighted tag in the composition
     buffer.  You can use mouse button 3 on this tag to set the default
     content disposition of the attachment.  The content disposition
     gives a hint to the recipient's mailer how to treat the
     attachment.  Specifically the disposition will indicate whether
     the attachment should be displayed along with the message or saved
     to a file.  Any text in the composition that appears before the
     tag will appear in a MIME text part before the attachment when the
     message is encoded and sent.  Similarly, any text after the tag
     will appear after the attachment in the encoded message.  If you
     change your mind about using the attachment, you can remove it
     from the composition with <C-k>.  If you want to move the
     attachment to some other part of the message, you can kill it
     <C-k> and yank it back with <C-y>.

`C-c C-m (`vm-mime-attach-message')'
     Attaches a mail message to the composition.  If invoked with a
     prefix argument, the name of a folder read from the minibuffer and
     the message or messages to be attached are copied from that
     folder.  You will be prompted for the message number of the
     message to be attached.  If you invoke the command on marked
     messages by running `vm-next-command-uses-marks' first, the marked
     messages in the selected folder will be attached as a MIME digest.  

`C-c C-b (`vm-mime-attach-buffer')'
     Attaches an Emacs buffer to the composition.

`C-c C-e (`vm-mime-encode-composition')'
     Encodes the composition using MIME, but does not send it.  This is
     useful if you want to use PGP to sign a message before sending it.
     After signing the message, you would use C-c C-c as usual to send
     the message.  Emacs' `undo' command can be used to undo the
     encoding, so that you can continue composing the unencoded message.

`C-c C-p (`vm-preview-composition')'
     Previews the current composition.  The message is copied into a
     temporary folder and you can read the message and interact with it
     using normal VM mode commands to see how it might look to a
     recipient.  Type <q> to quit the temporary folder and resume
     composing your message.

`C-c C-d (`vm-postpone-composition')'
     Postpones the current composition.  The message is stored in the
     folder specified in `vm-postponed-folder'.  You can continue
     composing of messages by visiting `vm-postponed-folder', selecting
     a massage and <m> or by directly calling the function on any
     message in any folder `M-x vm-continue-postponed-message'.  When
     called with a prefix argument `vm-postpone-composition' will ask
     you for the folder to save the draft to, i.e. you might also save
     it to your inbox.


   The simplest command is `m' (`vm-mail') which sends a mail message
much as `M-x mail' does but allows the added commands described above.

   `vm-mail' can be invoked outside of VM by typing `M-x vm-mail'.
However, only (`vm-yank-message-other-folder') will work; all the other
commands require a parent folder.

   If you send a message and it is returned by the mail system because
it was undeliverable, you can resend the message by typing `M-r'
(`vm-resend-bounced-message').  VM will extract the old message and its
pertinent headers from the returned message, and place you in a VM Mail
mode buffer.  A Resent-To header will be added, which you can fill in
with the corrected addresses of the recipients that bounced.  You can
also added a Resent-Cc header, which has the same meaning as a Cc
header in a normal message.  Mail will only be sent to the addresses in
the Resent-To and Resent-Cc headers unless you delete both of those
headers.  In that case the To and Cc headers will be used.

4.1 MIME Composition
====================

To use VM's MIME composition features, you must have
`vm-send-using-mime' set to a non-`nil' value.  With MIME composition
enabled, VM will allow you to add file attachments to your composition
and will analyze your message when you send it and MIME encode it as
necessary.

* Menu:

* MIME attachments::    Sending a message using MIME attachments.
* MIME characters::     Sending a message with MIME-encoded characters.
* MIME headers::        Sending a message with MIME-encoded headers.
* MIME preview::        Previewing a MIME message before sending.


File: vm.info,  Node: MIME attachments,  Next: MIME characters,  Prev: MIME Composition,  Up: MIME Composition

MIME attachments
================

To attach a file to your composition, use `C-c C-a'
(`vm-mime-attach-file').  VM will ask you for the name of the file, its
type, a brief description and its character set if it is a text
attachment.  The attachment will be represented in the composition as a
tag line like this

   [ATTACHMENT ~/sounds/chronophasia_scream.au, audio/basic]

   You can type text before and after this tag and it will appear
before or after the text in the final MIME message when VM encodes it.
You can kill the tag with `C-k' and yank it back with `C-y' to move it
to another place in the message.  You can yank back the tag multiple
times to duplicate the attachment in the message.  Or you can leave the
tag killed and the attachment won't appear in the message when it is
sent.

   If you click the right mouse button on the attachment tag, a menu
will appear that allows you to change the content disposition of the
attachment.  The "content disposition" of a MIME object gives a mail
reader a hint as to whether an object should be displayed inline or as
an inert tag or button that you must activate in some fashion.
"Inline" display usually means that the object will be display within
or alongside the message text, if that is possible.  "Attachment", when
used as a content disposition, means that the object will likely be
displayed as a tag.  By default, VM specifies an inline disposition for
all MIME types except `application' and `model' types.

   To attach a buffer instead of a file, use `C-c C-b' (normally bound
to `vm-mime-attach-buffer'.  You must not kill the buffer that you
attach until after the message has been sent.


File: vm.info,  Node: MIME characters,  Next: MIME headers,  Prev: MIME attachments,  Up: MIME Composition

MIME characters
===============

By default, when you type text into a composition buffer VM assumes
that if all the character codes are less than 128, you are using the
US-ASCII character set and that is the character set declared in the
encoding of the message when it is sent.  If you are using some other
character set, you must specify it by setting the variable
`vm-mime-7bit-composition-charset'.  The value of this variable should
be a string specifying the character set.

   If there are character codes in the composition greater than 128, the
variable `vm-mime-8bit-composition-charset' tells VM what character set
to assume when encoding the message.  The default is `iso-8859-1'.

   Character codes greater than 128 may not be transported reliably
across the Internet in mail messages.  Some machines will refuse to
accept messages containing such characters and some will accept them
but zero the eighth bit, garbling the message.  To avoid these
problems, VM transfer encodes 8-bit text by default.

   MIME has two transfer encodings that convert 8-bit data to 7-bit data
for safe transport.  "Quoted-printable" leaves the text mostly readable
even if the recipient does not have a MIME-capable mail reader.
"BASE64" is unreadable without a MIME-capable mail reader.

   VM's text transfer encoding behavior is controlled by the variable
`vm-mime-8bit-text-transfer-encoding'.  Its value should be a symbol
that specifies what kind of transfer encoding to do for 8-bit text.  A
value of `quoted-printable', means to use quoted-printable encoding.  A
value of `base64' means to use BASE64 encoding.  A value of `8bit'
means to send the message as is.  Note that this variable usually only
applies to textual MIME content types.  Images, audio, video, etc.
typically will have some attribute that makes VM consider them to be
"binary", which moves them outside the scope of this variable.  For
example, messages with line lengths of 1000 characters or more are
considered binary, as are messages that contain carriage returns (ASCII
code 13) or NULs (ASCII code 0).

MIME headers
============

The internet standards specify that the header lines of messages should
always be in 7 bit ASCII, even if the body of a message can use an 8
bit character set.  If you use other non-ASCII characters in typing the
headers then VM encodes their words using the MIME encoded-word syntax,
which is of the form `=?charset?encoding?encoded text?='.

   The variable `vm-mime-encode-headers-regexp' specifies which headers
should be encoded in this way.  By default, `Subject', `Organization',
`From', `To', `CC', `Bcc' and `Resent-' header lines encoded.  The
words are encoded using quoted-printable encoding (`Q').  You can ask
VM to use the base64 encoding by setting the variable
`vm-mime-encode-headers-type'.

   The variables `vm-mime-encode-words.regexp' and
`vm-mime-encode-headers-words-regexp' control what is meant by a "word"
for VM for the purpose of encoding.  By default, the words are those
containing any 8 bit character and delimited by white space characters.


File: vm.info,  Node: MIME preview,  Prev: MIME headers,  Up: MIME Composition

MIME preview
============

To preview what a MIME message will look like to a recipient, use `C-c
C-p' (`vm-mime-preview-composition').  VM will encode a copy of the
message and present it to you in a temporary mail folder.  You can
scroll through the message using normal VM mail reading commands.
Typing `q' in this folder will return you to your composition where you
can make further changes.

   To encode a MIME message without sending it, use `C-c C-e'
(`vm-mime-encode-composition').  This is useful if you use PGP and want
to sign a message before sending it.  VM will encode the message for
transport, inserting all necessary headers and boundary markers.  You
can then sign the message and send it with C-c C-c and be confident
that VM won't invalidate the signature by making further modifications
to the message.  Or if you want to resume editing the message you can
run the Emacs `undo' (normally bound to `C-x u') command which will
revert the encoded MIME bodies back to tags and you can continue
entering your composition.


File: vm.info,  Node: Replying,  Next: Forwarding Messages,  Prev: MIME Composition,  Up: Sending Messages

4.2 Replying
============

VM has special commands that make it easy to reply to a message.  When a
reply command is invoked, VM fills in the subject and recipient headers
for you, since it is apparent to whom the message should be sent and
what the subject should be.  There is an old convention of prepending
the string ```Re: ''' to the subject of replies if the string isn't
present already.  VM supports this indirectly by providing the variable
`vm-reply-subject-prefix'.  Its value should be a string to prepend to
the subject of replies, if the string isn't present already.  A `nil'
value means don't prepend anything to the subject (this is the
default).  In any case you can edit any of the message headers
manually, if you wish.

   VM also helps you cite material from a message to which you are
replying by providing "included text" as a feature of some of the
commands.  "Included text" is a copy of the message being replied to
with some fixed string prepended to each line so that included text can
be distinguished from the text of the reply.  The variable
`vm-included-text-prefix' specifies what the prepended string will be.

   (Note: VM allows you to cite any messages in a message you compose.
Your message does not have to be a reply.  Neither do the cited messages
have to be the messages you are replying to.)

   The variable `vm-included-text-attribution-format' specifies the
format for the attribution of included text.  This attribution is a line
of text that tells who wrote the text that is to be included; it will be
inserted before the included text.  If non-`nil', the value of
`vm-included-text-attribution-format' should be a string format
specification similar to `vm-summary-format'.  *Note Summaries::.  A
`nil' value causes the attribution to be omitted.

   By default, VM uses its MIME displaying mechanism to extract the
included text to be cited in replies.  If this does not work correctly,
you can set the variable `vm-included-mime-types-list' to a list of
MIME types that should be covered in the included text.  The list should
have `text/plain' at a minimum and could include other types such as
`text/enriched' and `message'.  Setting the variable to nil returns you
to the default behaviour.  Another possible way to extract included
text is to use the contents of the presentation buffer.  You can ask VM
to do so by setting the variable `vm-include-text-from-presentation' to
t.

   The variable `vm-in-reply-to-format' specifies the format of the
In-Reply-To header that is inserted into the header section of the reply
buffer.  Like `vm-included-text-attribution-format',
`vm-in-reply-to-format' should be a string similar to that of
`vm-summary-format'.  A `nil' value causes the In-Reply-To header to be
omitted.  If the format includes elements that can contain non-ASCII
characters, then `In-Reply-To' should be added to
`vm-mime-encode-headers-regexp'.

   The recipient headers generated for reply messages are created by
copying the appropriate headers from the message to which you are
replying.  This includes any full name information, comments, etc. in
these headers.  If the variable `vm-strip-reply-headers' is non-`nil',
the recipient headers will be stripped of all information except the
actual addresses.

   The reply commands are:

`r (`vm-reply')'
     Replies to the author of the current message.  

`R (`vm-reply-include-text')'
     Replies to the author of the current message and provides included
     text.  

`f (`vm-followup')'
     Replies to the all recipients of the current message.  

`F (`vm-followup-include-text')'
     Replies to the all recipients of the current message and provides
     included text.

   These commands all accept a numeric prefix argument N, which if
present, causes VM to reply to the next (or previous if the argument is
negative) N-1 messages as well as the current message.  Also, all the
reply commands set the "replied" attribute of the messages to which you
are responding, but only when the reply is actually sent.  The reply
commands can also be applied to marked messages, *note Marking
Messages::.

   If you are one of multiple recipients of a message and you use `f'
and `F', your address will be included in the recipients of the reply.
You can avoid this by judicious use of the variable
`vm-reply-ignored-addresses'.  Its value should be a list of regular
expressions that match addresses that VM should automatically remove
from the recipient headers of replies.


File: vm.info,  Node: Forwarding Messages,  Prev: Replying,  Up: Sending Messages

4.3 Forwarding Messages
=======================

VM has three commands to forward messages: `z' (`vm-forward-message'),
<@> (`vm-send-digest') and `B' (`vm-resend-message').

   Typing `z' puts you into a VM Mail mode buffer just like `m', except
the current message appears as the body of the message in the VM Mail
mode buffer. The forwarded message encapsulated as specified by the
variable `vm-forwarding-digest-type'.  Recognized values are
`"rfc934"', `"rfc1153"' and `"mime"'.  If the variable
`vm-forwarding-subject-format' is non-`nil' it should specify the
format of the Subject header of the forwarded message.  A `nil' value
causes the Subject header to be left blank.  The forwarded message is
flagged "forwarded" when the message is sent.

   The command <@> (`vm-send-digest') works like `z' except that a
digest of all the messages in the current folder is made and inserted
into the VM Mail mode buffer.  Also, `vm-send-digest' can be applied to
just marked messages.  *Note Marking Messages::.  When applied to
marked messages, `vm-send-digest' will only bundle marked messages, as
opposed to the usual bundling of all messages in the current folder.
The message encapsulation method is specified by the variable
`vm-digest-send-type', which accepts the same values as
`vm-forwarding-digest-type'.  All the messages included in the digest
will be flagged "forwarded" when the digest message is sent.

   If you give `vm-send-digest' a prefix argument, VM will insert a
list of preamble lines at the beginning of the digest, one line per
digestified message.  The variable `vm-digest-preamble-format'
determines the format of the preamble lines.  If the value of
`vm-digest-center-preamble' is non-`nil', the preamble lines will be
centered.

   If you wish to forward a message and want to send it without the
encapsulation used by `vm-forward-message', use `B'
(`vm-resend-message').  Instead of encapsulating the message, VM will
use essentially the same message and headers and add a Resent-To header
that you should fill in with the new recipients.  Use `C-c C-c' as
usual to send the message.  The resent message will be flagged as
"redistributed".

   You can control which header lines are included in forwarded messages
via the variables `vm-forwarded-headers' and
`vm-unforwarded-header-regexp'.  By default, both of these variables
are nil, which means that all headers should be included.  If
`vm-unforwarded-header-regexp' is set to a regular expression then all
the headers matching the regular expression are omitted in forwarded
messages.  If this variable is nil but `vm-forwarded-headers' is set to
a list of headers, then only these headers are included in the
forwarded messages.  See the documentation of these variables for
further information.

5 Saving Messages
*****************

Mail messages are normally saved to files that contain only mail
messages.  Such files are called "folders".  Folders are distinguished
from spool files in that VM does not expect other programs to modify
them while VM is visiting them.  This is important to remember.  VM
does no locking of folders when visiting them.  If the disk copy of a
folder is modified behind VM's back, Emacs will complain with the
dreaded "File changed on disk" message when you try to save the folder.

   The VM command to save a message to a folder is `s'
(`vm-save-message'); invoking this command causes the current message
to be saved to a folder whose name you specify in the minibuffer.  If
`vm-save-message' is given a prefix argument N, the current message
plus the next N-1 messages are saved.  If N is negative, the current
message and the previous N-1 messages are saved.  Messages saved with
`vm-save-message' are flagged "filed".

   One can save messages to remote IMAP folders by
`vm-save-message-to-imap-folder'; the name of the folder can be entered
from the minibuffer.

   If the value of the variable `vm-confirm-new-folders' is non-`nil',
VM will ask for confirmation before creating a new folder on
interactive saves.

   A non-`nil' value of `vm-imap-save-to-server' means that messages
from IMAP folders should be saved in other IMAP folds on the same
server.  Otherwise, the messages are saved to local folders.

   If you have a directory where you keep all your mail folders, you
should set the variable `vm-folder-directory' to point to it.  If this
variable is set, `vm-save-message' will insert this directory name into
the minibuffer before prompting you for a folder name; this will save
you some typing. The default value of `vm-folder-directory' is `~/Mail'.

   Another aid to selecting folders in which to save mail is the
variable `vm-auto-folder-alist'.  The value of this variable should be a
list of the form:

     ((HEADER-NAME
        (REGEXP . FOLDER-NAME) ...)
       ...)

   where HEADER-NAME and REGEXP are strings, and FOLDER-NAME is a
string or an s-expression that evaluates to a string.

   If any part of the contents of the message header named by
HEADER-NAME is matched by the regular expression REGEXP, VM will
evaluate the corresponding FOLDER-NAME and use the result as the
default when prompting for a folder to save the message in.  If the
resulting folder name is a relative path name it resolves to the
directory named by `vm-folder-directory', or the `default-directory' of
the currently visited folder if `vm-folder-directory' is `nil'.

   When FOLDER-NAME is evaluated, the current buffer will contain only
the contents of the header named by HEADER-NAME.  It is safe to modify
this buffer.  You can use the match data from any `\( ...  \)' grouping
constructs in REGEXP along with the function `buffer-substring' to
build a folder name based on the header information.  If the result of
evaluating FOLDER-NAME is a list, then the list will be treated as
another auto-folder-alist and will be descended recursively.

   Whether matching is case sensitive depends on the value of the
variable `vm-auto-folder-case-fold-search'.  A non-`nil' value makes
matching case insensitive.  The default value is `t', which means
matching is case insensitive.  Note that the matching of header names is
always case insensitive because the Internet message standard RFC 822
specifies that header names are case indistinct.

   VM can save messages to a folder in two distinct ways.  The message
can be appended directly to the folder on disk, or the folder can be
visited as Emacs would visit any other file and the message appended to
that buffer.  In the latter method you must save the buffer yourself to
change the on-disk copy of the folder.  The variable
`vm-visit-when-saving' controls which method is used.  A value of `t'
causes VM to always visit a folder before saving message to it.  A
`nil' value causes VM to always append directly to the folder file.  In
this case VM will not save messages to the disk copy of a folder that
is being visited.  This restriction is necessary to insure that the
buffer and on-disk copies of the folder are consistent. If the value of
`vm-visit-when-saving' is not `nil' and not `t' (e.g. 0, the default),
VM will append to the folder's buffer if the buffer is currently being
visited, otherwise VM will append to the file itself.

   After a message is saved to a folder, the usual thing to do next is
to delete it.  If the variable `vm-delete-after-saving' is non-`nil',
VM will flag messages for deletion automatically after saving them.
This applies only to saves to folders, not for the `w' or `A' commands
(see below).  The variable `vm-delete-after-archiving' works like
`vm-delete-after-saving' but applies to the `A'
(`vm-auto-archive-messages') command instead.

   Other commands:

`w (`vm-save-message-sans-headers')'
     Saves a message or messages to a file without their headers.  This
     command responds to a prefix argument exactly as `vm-save-message'
     does.  Messages saved this way are flagged "written".  

`A (`vm-auto-archive-messages')'
     Save all unfiled messages that auto-match a folder via
     `vm-auto-folder-alist' to their appropriate folders.  Messages that
     are flagged for deletion are not saved by this command.  If
     invoked with a prefix argument, confirmation will be requested for
     each save.  

`|| (`vm-pipe-message-to-command')'
     Runs a shell command with some or all of the current message as
     input.  By default, the entire message is used.  However, the
     leading and trailing message separator lines are not included.
     When applied to multiple messages, the command is invoked on each
     message individually.
     If invoked with one C-u the text portion of the message is used.
     If invoked with two C-u's the header portion of the message is
     used.
     In invoked with three C-u's the visible headers and the text
     portions of the message are used.
     If the shell command generates any output, it is displayed in a
     `*Shell Command Output*' buffer.  The message itself is not
     altered.  

`|d (`vm-pipe-message-to-command-discard-output')'
     Runs a shell command with some or all of the current message as
     input, like the above, but will not display the output.  

`|s (`vm-pipe-messages-to-command')'
     Runs a shell command using as input the current message or marked
     messages in the mbox format.  In contrast to
     `vm-pipe-message-to-command', the leading and trailing separator
     lines are included.  This behaviour can be altered using the
     variables `vm-pipe-messages-to-command-start' and
     `vm-pipe-messages-to-command-end'.  

`|n (`vm-pipe-messages-to-command-discard-output')'
     Runs a shell command using as input the current message or marked
     messages in the mbox format, but will not display the output.

   A non-`nil' value of `vm-berkeley-mail-compatibility' means to read
and write BSD Mail(1) style Status: headers.  This makes sense if you
plan to use VM to read mail archives created by Mail.

6 Deleting Messages
*******************

In VM, messages are flagged for deletion, and then are subsequently
"expunged" or removed from the folder.  The messages are not removed
from the on-disk copy of the folder until the folder is saved.

`d (`vm-delete-message')'
     Flags the current message for deletion.  A prefix argument N
     causes the current message and the next N-1 messages to be flagged.
     A negative N causes the current message and the previous N-1
     messages to be flagged.  

`u (`vm-undelete-message')'
     Removes the deletion flag from the current message.  A prefix
     argument N causes the current message and the next N-1 messages to
     be undeleted.  A negative N causes the current message and the
     previous N-1 messages to be undeleted.  

`k (`vm-kill-subject')'
     Flags all messages with the same subject as the current message
     (ignoring "Re:") for deletion.  

``vm-delete-duplicate-messages''
     Flags duplicate messages for deletion.  The duplicate messages are
     detected by comparing message ID's.  

``vm-delete-duplicate-messages-by-body''
     Flags duplicate messages for deletion.  The duplicate messages are
     detected by comparing message bodies.  

`### (`vm-expunge-folder')'
     Does the actual removal of messages flagged for deletion in the
     current folder.

   Setting the variable `vm-move-after-deleting' non-`nil' causes VM to
move past the messages after flagging them for deletion.  Setting
`vm-move-after-undeleting' non-`nil' causes similar movement after
undeletes.  Setting `vm-move-after-killing' non-`nil' causes VM to move
after killing messages with `vm-kill-subject'.  Note that the movement
is done by calling `vm-next-message' which means that the value of
`vm-circular-folders' applies to the post-command motion as for a
motion command, not as for a non-motion command.

7 Editing Messages
******************

To edit a message, type `e' (`vm-edit-message').  The current message
is copied into a temporary buffer, and this buffer is selected for
editing.  The major mode of this buffer is controlled by the variable
`vm-edit-message-mode'.  The default is Text mode.

   Use `C-c ESC' (`vm-edit-message-end') when you have finished editing
the message.  The message will be inserted into its folder, replacing
the old version of the message.  If you want to quit the edit without
your edited version replacing the original, use `C-c C-]'
(`vm-edit-message-abort'), or you can just kill the edit buffer with
`C-x k' (`kill-buffer').

   If you give a prefix argument to `vm-edit-message', then the current
message will be flagged unedited.

   As with VM Mail mode buffers, all VM commands can be accessed from
the edit buffer through the command prefix `C-c C-v'.

8 Marking Messages
******************

VM provides a way to mark selected messages so that subsequent
operations can be applied to them.  This is similar to marking in other
parts of Emacs, e.g., *Note Dired Marks: (emacs)Marks vs Flags, but
arguably more powerful.  For example, one can mark all messages from a
particular sender and save them to a folder, or mark all messages with
a particular subject and print them.  One can also mark messages by
searching for particular strings in their text.

   To mark the current message, type `M M' (`vm-mark-message').  If you
give a numeric prefix argument N, the next N-1 messages will be marked
as well.  A negative prefix argument means mark the previous N-1.  An
asterisk (`*') will appear to the right of the message numbers of all
marked messages in the summary window.

   To remove a mark from the current message, use `M U'
(`vm-unmark-message').  Prefix arguments work as with `vm-mark-message'.

   Use `M m' to mark all messages in the current folder; `M u' removes
marks from all messages.

   Other marking commands:

`M C (`vm-mark-matching-messages')'
     Mark all messages matched by a virtual folder selector.  *Note
     Virtual Folders::.  

`M c (`vm-unmark-matching-messages')'
     Unmark all messages matched by a virtual folder selector.  

`M T (`vm-mark-thread-subtree')'
     Mark all messages in the thread tree rooted at current message.
     *Note Threading::.  

`M t (`vm-unmark-thread-subtree')'
     Unmark all messages in the thread tree rooted at current message.  

`M S (`vm-mark-same-subject')'
     Mark messages with the same subject as the current message.  

`M s (`vm-unmark-same-subject')'
     Unmark messages with the same subject as the current message.  

`M A (`vm-mark-same-author')'
     Mark messages with the same author as the current message.  

`M a (`vm-unmark-same-author')'
     Unmark messages with the same author as the current message.

   To apply a VM command to all marked messages you must prefix it with
the key sequence `M N' (`vm-next-command-uses-marks').  The next VM
command will apply to all marked messages, provided the command can be
applied to such messages in a meaningful and useful way.  Unfortunately,
as of this writing, this mechanism works only if the next command
invoked is a keyboard command.  Commands invoked by `M-x' are unable to
access the marked messages.  So, to invoke a complex command, you might
temporarily bind it to an unused key, e.g.,

     M-x local-set-key C vm-forward-message-all-headers
     M N C

forwards marked messages with all headers included.

9 Message Attributes
********************

Each message in a folder has a set of attributes that VM will remember
from session to session.  Various VM commands set and unset these
attributes.  Here are the attributes maintained by VM.

`new'
     The message was retrieved from a spool file during this visit of
     the current folder.

`unread'
     The message was retrieved from a spool file during some past visit
     of the folder but is still unread.

`filed'
     The message has been saved to some folder.

`written'
     The body of the message has been saved to a file.

`edited'
     The message has been altered (with `vm-edit-message') since it
     arrived.

`deleted'
     The message is deleted and will be removed from the folder at the
     next expunge.

`forwarded'
     The message has been forwarded with either `vm-forward-message' or
     `vm-send-digest'.

`redistributed'
     The message has been forwarded with the `vm-resend-message'
     command.

`replied'
     The message has been replied to.

   You can set and unset these attributes directly by using `a'
(`vm-set-message-attributes').  You will be prompted in the minibuffer
for names of the attributes and you can enter them with completion.
Every attribute has an "un-" prefixed name you can use to unset the
attribute, excepting "new" and "unread", which are both negated by
"read".  You can use a prefix argument with this command to affect
multiple messages, and you can apply this command to marked messages
with `M N'.

   VM provides a special form of undo which allows changes to message
attributes to be undone.  Typing `C-x u' or <C-_> (`vm-undo') undoes
the last attribute change.  Consecutive `vm-undo''s undo further and
further back.  Any intervening command breaks the undo chain, after
which the undo's themselves become undoable by subsequent invocations
of `vm-undo'.

   Note that expunges, saves and message edits are _not_ undoable.

   "Labels" are user-defined message attributes.  They can have any
name and be assigned any meaning by you.  Labels are added with `l a'
(`vm-add-message-labels' and `l e' (`vm-add-existing-message-labels',
and are removed by `l d' (`vm-delete-message-labels').  BABYL format
folders use labels to store basic attributed like "deleted" and
"unread".  When visiting a BABYL folder VM uses these labels also in
order to be compatible with other BABYL mailers.  The labels used are
"recent", "unseen", "deleted", "answered", "forwarded",
"redistributed", "filed", "edited" and "written".  If (and only if) you
are using BABYL format folders, you should not use these label names
for your own purposes.

   All message attributes are stored in the folder.  In order for
attribute changes to be saved to disk, they must be written to the
folder's buffer prior to the buffer being saved.  The variable
`vm-flush-interval' controls how often that is done.  A value of `t'
means write the new attributes to the folder buffer whenever a change
occurs.  A value of `nil' means wait until just before the folder is
saved before writing out the attributes.  VM will work faster with this
setting, but if Emacs or your system crashes, the autosave file will
contain no useful data pertaining to message attribute changes.  The
autosave file will still reflect message edits and expunges.  *Note
Crash Recovery::.  A positive integer value N instructs VM to write out
attribute changes every N seconds.  The default value of this variable
is `t'.

10 Sorting Messages
*******************

In order to make numerous related messages easier to cope with, VM
provides the command `G' (`vm-sort-messages'), which sorts all messages
in a folder using one or more sort keys.  By default the actual order
of the messages in the folder is not altered; that is, if you looked at
the folder file outside of VM the message order would be unchanged.  VM
numbers and presents the messages in a different order internally.  If
you want the message order to be changed in the folder so that other
programs can see the change, you can either invoke `vm-sort-messages'
with a prefix argument, or you can set `vm-move-messages-physically'
non-`nil' before sorting.  Either way, VM will shift the actual
messages around in the folder buffer, and when you save the folder, the
order change will be visible to other programs.

   Valid sort keys are:
date                      reversed-date
author                    reversed-author
subject                   reversed-subject
recipients                reversed-recipients
line-count                reversed-line-count
byte-count                reversed-byte-count
physical-order            reversed-physical-order
spam-score                reversed-spam-score

   When sorting by subject (or threading using subjects, or killing
messages by subject) the subject of the message is "normalized" before
comparisons are done.  A "normalized" subject has uninteresting
prefixes and suffixes stripped off, and multiple consecutive white
space characters are collapsed to a single space.  The variable
`vm-subject-ignored-prefix' should be a regular expression that matches
all strings at the beginning of a subject that you do not want to be
considered when message subjects are compared.  A `nil' value means VM
should not ignore any prefixes.  The analogous variable for subject
suffixes is `vm-subject-ignored-suffix'.

   Once the subject has been normalized, the variable
`vm-subject-significant-chars' controls how much of what remains is
considered significant for matching purposes.  The first
`vm-subject-significant-chars' will be considered significant.
Characters beyond this point in the subject string will be ignored.  A
`nil' value for this variable means all characters in the subject are
significant.

   If you want to move messages around by hand, use `C-M-n'
(`vm-move-message-forward') and `C-M-p' (`vm-move-message-backward').
The default is to move the current message forward or backward by one
message in the message list.  A prefix argument N can specify a longer
move.  The value of `vm-move-messages-physically' applies to these
commands.

* Threading::   Using subjects and message IDs to group messages.


File: vm.info,  Node: Threading,  Up: Sorting Messages

10.1 Threading
==============

A "thread" is a group of messages that are either related by subject or
that have a common ancestor.  "Threading" is the process of determining
the relationship between such messages and displaying them so that
those relationships are evident.

   To enable and disable threading, type `C-t'
(`vm-toggle-threads-display'.  In the summary buffer related messages
are grouped together and the subject part of the summary listings of
messages are indented to show hierarchical relationships.  Parent
messages are displayed before their children and children are indented
a default two spaces to the right for each level of descendence from
their ancestors.  The amount of indentation per level is controlled by
the variable `vm-summary-thread-indent-level'.

   Message relationships are discovered by examining References,
In-Reply-To, and Subject headers.  The first two headers are more
reliable sources of information but not all mailers provide them.  If
you don't want VM to use Subject headers, set the variable
`vm-thread-using-subject' to `nil'.

   If you want VM to always display messages using threads, you should
set the default value of the variable `vm-summary-show-threads'
non-`nil' in your VM init file.  Example:

     (setq-default vm-summary-show-threads t)

Do not use `setq', as this will only set the value of the variable in a
single buffer.  Once you've started VM you should not change the value
of this variable.  Rather you should use `C-t' to control the thread
display.

   Note that threading is really a specialized form of sorting, and so
the value of the variable `vm-move-messages-physically' applies.


File: vm.info,  Node: Digests,  Next: Summaries,  Prev: Sorting Messages,  Up: Top

11 Digests
**********

A "digest" is one or more mail messages encapsulated within another
message.

   VM supports digests by providing a command to "burst" them into their
individual messages.  These messages can then be handled like any other
messages under VM.

   The command `*' (`vm-burst-digest') bursts a digest into its
individual messages and appends them to the current folder.  These
messages are then assimilated into the current folder as new messages.
The original digest message is not altered, and the messages extracted
from it are not part of the on-disk copy of the folder until a save is
done.  You will be prompted for the type of digest to burst.  VM
understands three formats, "rfc934", "rfc1154" and "mime".  If you
don't know what kind of digest you've received, type "guess" and VM
will try to figure out the digest type on its own.  VM is pretty smart
about digests and will usually make the correct choice if the digest is
properly formatted.


File: vm.info,  Node: Summaries,  Next: Virtual Folders,  Prev: Digests,  Up: Top

12 Summaries
************

Typing `h' (`vm-summarize') causes VM to display a summary of contents
of the current folder.  The information in the summary is automatically
updated as changes are made to the current folder.  An arrow `->'
appears to the left of the line summarizing the current message.  The
variable `vm-auto-center-summary' controls whether VM will keep the
summary arrow vertically centered within the summary window.  A value
of `t' causes VM to always keep the arrow centered.  A value of `nil'
(the default) means VM will never bother centering the arrow.  A value
that is not `nil' and not `t' causes VM to center the arrow only if the
summary window is not the only existing window.  You can change what
the summary arrow looks like by setting vm-summary-arrow to a string
depicting the new arrow.  You should set this variable before VM
creates the summary buffer.

   The variable `vm-summary-format' controls the format of each
message's summary.  Its value should be a string.  This string should
contain printf-like "%" conversion specifiers which substitute
information about the message into the final summary.

   Recognized specifiers are:
`a'
     attribute indicators (always four characters wide)
     The first char is  `D', `N', `U' or ` ' for deleted, new, unread
     and read messages respectively.
     The second char is `F', `W' or ` ' for filed (saved) or written
     messages.
     The third char is `R', `Z' or ` ' for messages replied to, and
     forwarded messages.
     The fourth char is `E' if the message has been edited, ` '
     otherwise.

`A'
     longer version of attributes indicators (seven characters wide).
     The first char is  `D', `N', `U' or ` ' for deleted, new, unread
     and read messages respectively.
     The second is `r' or ` ', for message replied to.
     The third is `z' or ` ', for messages forwarded.
     The fourth is `b' or ` ', for messages redistributed.
     The fifth is `f' or ` ', for messages filed.
     The sixth is `w' or ` ', for messages written.
     The seventh is `e' or ` ', for messages that have been edited.

`P'
     indicator for a message with attachments.  The variable `vm-summary-attachment-indicator'
     is the inserted string, by default a `$'.

`p'
     indicator for a postponed message.  The variable `vm-summary-postponed-indicator'
     is the inserted string, by default a `P'.

`c'
     number of characters in message (ignoring headers)

`S'
     human readable size of the message

`d'
     numeric day of month message sent

`f'
     author's address

`F'
     author's full name (same as f if full name not found)

`h'
     hour:min:sec message sent

`H'
     hour:min message sent

`i'
     message ID

`I'
     thread indentation

`l'
     number of lines in message (ignoring headers)

`L'
     labels (as a comma list)

`m'
     month message sent

`M'
     numeric month message sent (January = 1)

`n'
     message number

`s'
     message subject

`t'
     addresses of the recipients of the message, in a comma-separated
     list

`T'
     full names of the recipients of the message, in a comma-separated
     list If a full name cannot be found, the corresponding address is
     used instead.

`U'
     user defined specifier.  The next character in the format string
     should be a letter.  VM will call the function
     vm-summary-function-<letter> (e.g. vm-summary-function-A for
     "%UA") in the folder buffer with the message being summarized
     bracketed by (point-min) and (point-max).  The function will be
     passed a message struct as an argument.  The function should
     return a string, which VM will insert into the summary as it would
     for information from any other summary specifier.

`w'
     day of the week message sent

`y'
     year message sent

`z'
     timezone of date when the message was sent

`*'
     `*' if the message is marked, ` ' otherwise

`('
     starts a group, terminated by %).  Useful for specifying the field
     width and precision for the concatenation of group of format
     specifiers.  Example: \"%.35(%I%s%)\" specifies a maximum display
     width of 35 characters for the concatenation of the thread
     indentation and the subject.

`)'
     ends a group.

   Use "%%" to get a single "%".

   A numeric field width may be specified between the "%" and the
specifier; this causes right justification of the substituted string.  A
negative field width causes left justification.  The field width may be
followed by a "." and a number specifying the maximum allowed length of
the substituted string.  If the string is longer than this value, it is
truncated.

   If you save copies of all your outbound messages in a folder and
later visit that folder, the `%F' format specifier will normally
display your own name.  If you would rather see the recipient addresses
in this case, set the variable `vm-summary-uninteresting-senders'. This
variable's value, if non-`nil', should be a regular expression that
matches addresses that you don't consider interesting enough to appear
in the summary.  When such senders would be displayed by the `%F' or
`%f' summary format specifiers VM will substitute the value of
`vm-summary-uninteresting-senders-arrow' (default "To: ") followed by
what would be shown by the `%T' and `%t' specifiers respectively.

   The summary format need not be one line per message but it must end
with a newline, otherwise the message pointer will not be displayed
correctly in the summary window.

   Summary lines are precomputed and cached in the folder buffer.  If
you change the `vm-summary-format', you need to force the cache to be
updated.  You can do this by the command`vm-fix-my-summary!!!'.

   Every folder can have its own summary format.  The format is written
into the folder and saved on the disk.  When you visit the folder
again, you can reuse the saved summary format.  Set the variable
`vm-restore-saved-summary-format' to t to achieve this effect.

   You can have a summary generated automatically at VM startup by
setting the variable `vm-startup-with-summary' non-nil.  *Note Starting
Up::.

   All VM commands are available in the summary buffer just as they are
in the folder buffer itself.  If you set `vm-follow-summary-cursor'
non-`nil', VM will select the message under the cursor in the summary
window before executing commands that operate on the current message.
Note that this occurs _only_ when executing a command from the summary
buffer window.

   A non-`nil' value of `vm-gargle-uucp' means to use a crufty regular
expression that does surprisingly well at beautifying UUCP addresses
that are substituted for `%f' and `%t' as part of summary and
attribution formats.

13 Virtual Folders
******************

A "virtual folder" is a mapping of messages from one or more real
folders into a container that in most ways acts like a real folder but
has no real existence outside of VM.  You can have a virtual folder
that contains a subset of messages in a real folder or several real
folders.  A virtual folder can also contain a subset of messages from
another virtual folder.

   A virtual folder is defined by its name, the folders that it contains
and its selectors.  The variable `vm-virtual-folder-alist' is a list of
the definitions of all named virtual folders.  In order to visit a
virtual folder with the `vm-visit-virtual-folder' (`V V') command, a
virtual folder must have an entry in vm-virtual-folder-alist.

   Each virtual folder definition should have the following form:

     (VIRTUAL-FOLDER-NAME
       ( (FOLDER-NAME ...)
         (SELECTOR [ARG ...]) ... )
       ... )

   VIRTUAL-FOLDER-NAME is the name of the virtual folder being defined.
This is the name by which you and VM will refer to this folder.

   FOLDER-NAME should be the name of a real folder.  There may be more
than one FOLDER-NAME listed, the SELECTORs within that sublist will
apply to them all.  If FOLDER-NAME is a directory, VM will assume this
to mean that all the folders in that directory should be searched.

   The SELECTOR is a Lisp symbol that tells VM how to decide whether a
message from one of the folders specified by the FOLDER-NAMEs should be
included in the virtual folder.  Some SELECTORs require an argument ARG;
unless otherwise noted ARG may be omitted.

`author'
     matches message if ARG matches the author; ARG should be a regular
     expression.

`author-or-recipient'
     matches message if ARG matches the author of the message or any of
     its recipients; ARG should be a regular expression.

`and'
     matches the message if all its argument selectors match the
     message.  Example:
          (and (author "Derek McGinty") (new))
     matches all new messages from Derek McGinty.  `and' takes any
     number of arguments.

`any'
     matches any message.

`deleted'
     matches message if it is flagged for deletion.

`edited'
     matches message if it has been edited.

`filed'
     matches message if it has been saved with its headers.

`forwarded'
     matches message if it has been forwarded using a variant of
     `vm-forward-message' or `vm-send-digest'.

`header'
     matches message if ARG matches any part of the header portion of
     the message; ARG should be a regular expression.

`header-or-text'
     matches message if ARG matches any part of the headers or the text
     portion of the message; ARG should be a regular expression.

`label'
     matches message if message has a label named ARG.

`less-chars-than'
     matches message if message has less than ARG characters.  ARG
     should be a number.

`less-lines-than'
     matches message if message has less than ARG lines.  ARG should be
     a number.

`more-chars-than'
     matches message if message has more than ARG characters.  ARG
     should be a number.

`more-lines-than'
     matches message if message has more than ARG lines.  ARG should be
     a number.

`marked'
     matches message if it is marked, as with `vm-mark-message'.

`new'
     matches message if it is new.

`not'
     matches message only if its selector argument does NOT match the
     message.  Example:
          (not (deleted))
     matches messages that are not deleted.

`or'
     matches the message if any of its argument selectors match the
     message.  Example:
          (or (author "Dave Weckl") (subject "drum"))
     matches messages from Dave Weckl or messages with the string
     "drum" in their Subject header.  `or' takes any number of
     arguments.

`read'
     matches message if it is neither new nor unread.

`recent'
     matches message if it is new.

`recipient'
     matches message if ARG matches any part of the recipient list of
     the message.  ARG should be a regular expression.

`redistributed'
     matches message if it has been redistributed using
     `vm-resend-message'.

`replied'
     matches message if it has been replied to.

`sent-after'
     matches message if it was sent after the date ARG.  A fully
     specified date looks like this:
          ``31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT''
     although the parts can appear in any order.  You can leave out any
     part and it will default to the current date's value for that
     part, with the exception of the `hh:mm:ss' part which defaults to
     midnight.

`sent-before'
     matches message if it was sent before the date ARG.  A fully
     specified date looks like this:
          ``31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT''
     although the parts can appear in any order.  You can leave out any
     part and it will default to the current date's value for that
     part, with the exception of the hh:mm:ss part which defaults to
     midnight.

`subject'
     matches message if ARG matches any part of the message's subject;
     ARG should be a regular expression.

`text'
     matches message if ARG matches any part of the text portion of the
     message; ARG should be a regular expression.

`unanswered'
     matches message if it has not been replied to.  Same as the
     `unreplied' selector.

`undeleted'
     matches message if it has not been deleted.

`unedited'
     matches message if it has not been edited.

`unfiled'
     matches message if it has not been saved with its headers.

`unforwarded'
     matches message if it has not been forwarded using
     `vm-forward-message' or `vm-send-digest' or one of their variants.

`unread'
     matches message if it is not new and hasn't been read.

`unseen'
     matches message if it is not new and hasn't been read.  Same as
     the `unread' selector.

`unredistributed'
     matches message if it has not been redistributed using
     `vm-resend-message'.

`unreplied'
     matches message if it has not been replied to.

`virtual-folder-member'
     matches message if the message is already a member of some virtual
     folder currently being visited.

`written'
     matches message if it has been saved without its headers.

`older-than'
     matches message if it is at least ARG days old

`eval'
     matches message if evaluating the sexpr ARG yields `t'.

`outgoing'
     matches message if your are the author of it, i.e. if the author
     matches `vm-summary-uninteresting-senders'

`spam-score'
     matches message if its spam score is at least ARG.  See
     `vm-vs-spam-score-headers' for configuration.

`spam-word'
     matches message if it contains a word from `vm-spam-words-file'

`folder-name'
     matches message if it is from a folder matching `ARG'

`in-bbdb'
     matches if the addresses from the message are in the BBDB. With an
     option first argument you might select the address class and with
     an optional second argument if only the first address should be
     checked.
          (in-bbdb authors)

          (in-bbdb recipients t)

`attachment'
     matches if a message contains an attachment resp. its text matched
     `vm-vs-attachment-regexp'

`vm-mode'
     matches the message if in vm-mode and one of its argument
     selectors match the message.

`mail-mode'
     matches the message if in mail-mode and one of its argument
     selectors match the message.

   Here is an example that you may find useful as a template to create
virtual folder definitions.

     (setq vm-virtual-folder-alist
        '(
          ;; start virtual folder definition
          ("virtual-folder-name"
           (("/path/to/folder" "/path/to/folder2")
            (header "foo")
            (header "bar")
           )
           (("/path/to/folder3" "/path/to/folder4")
            (and (header "baz") (header "woof"))
           )
          )
          ;; end of virtual folder definition
        )
     )

   The `text' selector provides a particularly effective way to search
for strings in messages.  It is better than the
`vm-isearch-forward/backward' functions because it avoids searching
inside encoded attachments, hence faster.

   Again, you visit virtual folders you have defined in
`vm-virtual-folder-alist' with `V V'.  Once you've visited a virtual
folder most VM commands work as they do in a normal folder.  There are
exceptions.  If you use `S' (`vm-save-folder', the folder save command
will be invoked on each real folder in turn.  Similarly if you use `g'
(`vm-get-new-mail' in a virtual folder, mail is retrieved from the
spool files associated with each of the real folders.  If any of the
retrieved messages are matched by the virtual folder's selector, they
will be added to the virtual folder.

   These commands will signal an error when invoked if the current
folder is a virtual folder:

         vm-save-buffer
         vm-write-file
         vm-change-folder-type
         vm-expunge-imap-messages
         vm-expunge-pop-messages

   Normally messages in a virtual folder share attributes with the
underlying real messages.  For example, if you delete a message in a
virtual folder, it is also flagged as deleted in the real folder.  If
you then run `vm-expunge-folder' in the virtual folder, the deleted
message is expunged from the virtual folder and from the real folder.
Labels are shared between virtual and real messages.  However virtual
folders have their own set of message marks.

   To make virtual folders not share message attributes with real
folders by default, set the variable `vm-virtual-mirror' to nil.  This
should be done in your VM init file and you should use `setq-default',
as this variable is automatically local to all buffers.

     (setq-default vm-virtual-mirror nil)

If you want to change whether the currently visited virtual folder
shares attributes with the underlying real folders, use the command
`vm-toggle-virtual-mirror' (bound to `V M').  If the virtual folder is
currently sharing attributes it will no longer be.  If it is not
sharing attributes with the underlying folders then it will be.

   The command `vm-create-virtual-folder' (bound to `V C') lets you
interactively create a virtual folder from the messages of the current
folder, using exactly one selector to choose the messages.  If you type
`V C header RET pigs', VM will create a folder containing only those
messages that contain the string `pigs' in the header.

   The command `vm-apply-virtual-folder' (bound to `V X') tries the
selectors of a named virtual folder against the messages of the current
folder and creates a virtual folder containing the matching messages.

   The keys `V S' and `V A' invoke
`vm-create-virtual-folder-same-subject' and
`vm-create-virtual-folder-same-author' which create virtual folders
containing all the messages in the current folder with the same subject
or author as the current message.

   The keys `V O' `vm-virtual-omit-message' will omit a message from the
virtual folder and `V U' `vm-virtual-update-folders' will force an
update of the virtual folder.

   `M-x vm-virtual-check-selector-interactive' allows to test selectors
interactively and will emit debug information when called with a prefix
argument.

   Automatic marking of messages for deletion based on a selector can be
achieved with `vm-virtual-auto-delete-message' for interactive use and
the function and `vm-virtual-auto-delete-messages' when added to the VM
hook `vm-arrived-messages-hook'.  This can be quite handy for marking
spam for deletion.

   `M-x vm-virtual-save-message' can be used to save messages to the
folder corresponding to the first matching selector and the function
`vm-virtual-auto-archive-messages' can file messages based on selectors
(see also `vm-auto-archive-messages').

14 Frames and Windows
*********************

VM uses Emacs frames and windows to display messages and summaries and
to provide a place for you to compose messages.  Using VM's frame
configuration facilities you can control when VM creates new frames and
the size and attributes associated with new frames.  Inside each frame
you can associate different window setups with commands and classes of
commands by using VM's window configuration facilities.

   To use VM's frame configuration features, the variable
`vm-mutable-frames' must be set non-`nil'.  This is the default.  If
`vm-mutable-frames' is set to nil VM will only use the current frame,
and VM will not create, delete or resize frames.

   To use window configurations, the variable `vm-mutable-windows' must
be set non-`nil'.  If `vm-mutable-windows' is set to nil, VM will only
use the selected window, and will not create, delete or resize windows.

File: vm.info,  Node: Frame Configuration,  Next: Window Configuration,  Prev: Frames and Windows,  Up: Frames and Windows

14.1 Frame Configuration
========================

VM has a set of variables that let you specify when VM creates frames
and what attributes the new frames will have.

   If `vm-frame-per-folder' is set non-`nil', when you visit a folder,
VM will create a new frame and display that folder in the new frame.
When you quit the folder, VM will delete the frame.

   If `vm-frame-per-summary' is set non-`nil', the `vm-summarize'
command will create a new frame in which to display a folder's summary
buffer.  This works best if a full-screen window configuration has been
assigned to the `vm-summarize' command.  When you quit the folder or
kill the summary, VM will delete the frame.

   Setting `vm-frame-per-composition' non-`nil' causes VM to create a
new frame for the composition buffer when you run any of VM's message
composition commands.  E.g. `vm-reply-include-text', `vm-mail',
`vm-forward-message'.  When you finish editing the composition and send
it, or when you kill the composition buffer, the frame will be deleted.

   The variable `vm-frame-per-edit', if non-`nil', tells VM to create a
new frame when the vm-edit-message command is run.  When you finish
editing the message, or abort the edit, the frame will be deleted.

   If `vm-frame-per-help' is set non-`nil', VM will create a new frame
to display any help buffer produced by the vm-help command.

   If `vm-frame-per-completion' is set non-`nil', VM will create a new
frame on mouse initiated completing reads.  A mouse initiated
completing read occurs when you invoke a VM command using the mouse,
either with a menu or a toolbar button.  That command must then prompt
you for information, and there must be a limited set of valid
responses.  If these conditions are met and `vm-frame-per-completion''s
value is non-`nil', VM will create a new frame containing a list of
responses that you can select with the mouse.

   When VM is deciding whether to create a new frame, it checks other
existing frames to see if a buffer that it wants to display in a frame
is already being displayed somewhere.  If so, then VM will not create a
new frame.  If you don't want VM to search other frames, set the
variable `vm-search-other-frames' to `nil'.  VM will still search the
currently selected frame and will not create a new frame if the buffer
that it wants to display is visible there.

   The variable `vm-frame-parameter-alist' allows you to specify the
frame parameters for newly created frames.

   The value of `vm-frame-parameter-alist' should be of this form

     ((SYMBOL PARAMLIST) (SYMBOL2 PARAMLIST2) ...)

   SYMBOL must be one of "completion", "composition", "edit", "folder",
"primary-folder" or "summary".  It specifies the type of frame that the
following PARAMLIST applies to.

`completion'
     specifies parameters for frames that display lists of choices
     generated by a mouse-initiated completing read.  (See
     `vm-frame-per-completion'.)

`composition'
     specifies parameters for mail composition frames.

`edit'
     specifies parameters for message edit frames (e.g. created by
     `vm-edit-message-other-frame')

`folder'
     specifies parameters for frames created by `vm' and the
     `vm-visit-' commands.

`primary-folder'
     specifies parameters for the frame created by running `vm' without
     any arguments.

`summary'
     specifies parameters for frames that display a summary buffer
     (e.g. created by `vm-summarize-other-frame')
   PARAMLIST is a list of pairs as described in the documentation for
the function `make-frame'.

14.2 Window Configuration
=========================

Window configurations allow you to specify how the windows within a
frame should look for a particular command or class of commands.  Each
command can have a configuration associated with it and you can also
associate a configuration with command classes like "reading-message"
or "composing-message".  To setup a window configuration, first use
Emacs' window management commands (`split-window', `enlarge-window',
etc.)  to make the windows in the frame look the way you want.  Then
use the switch-to-buffer command to put the buffers you want to see into
the windows.  Next type `W S', which invokes the
`vm-save-window-configuration' command.  Type the name of the command
or class of commands to which you want the configuration to apply.
Nearly all VM commands can be entered here.  Valid classes are:

         default
         startup
         quitting
         reading-message
         composing-message
         marking-message
         searching-message

   When a VM command is executed, window configurations are searched
for as follows.  First, a command specific configuration is searched
for.  If one is found, it is used.  Next a class configuration is
searched for.  Not all commands are in command classes.  Message
composition commands are in the "composing-message" class.  All the
`vm-quit*' commands are in the "quitting" class.  All the VM commands
that set and clear message marks are in the "marking-message" class,
and so on.  If such a class configuration is found it is used.  If no
matching class configuration is found, the "default" class
configuration is used, if it is defined.

   Note that when a window configuration is saved the selected window
at that time will be the selected window when that window configuration
is used.  So if you prefer for the cursor to be in a particular window,
make sure you invoke `vm-save-window-configuration' window from that
window.  Remember that you can invoke the command with `M-x' if VM's
normal key map is not in effect.

   To delete a window configuration, use `W D' which is bound to
`vm-delete-window-configuration'.  You will be prompted for the name of
the configuration to delete.

   To see what an existing configuration looks like, type `W W' which
invokes `vm-apply-window-configuration'.

   VM saves information about your window configurations in the file
named by the variable `vm-window-configuration-file'.  The default
location of the configuration file is `"~/.vm.windows"'.  Do not make
`vm-window-configuration-file' point to the same location as
`vm-init-file', as the window configuration save commands will then
overwrite the content of your init file.

15 Toolbar
**********

VM can display a toolbar that allows you to run VM commands with a
single mouse click.  By default the toolbar is displayed on the left of
the Emacs frame and is only visible if you're running under a window
system like X Windows or Microsoft Windows.

   To make VM not display the toolbar, set `vm-use-toolbar' to nil.  To
configure what buttons are displayed on the toolbar, you must change
the value of `vm-use-toolbar'.  If non-`nil', the value of
`vm-use-toolbar' should be a list of symbols and integers, which
specify which buttons appear on the toolbar and the layout of the
buttons.  These are the allowed symbols along with the buttons they
represent.

`autofile'
     The AutoFile button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-autofile-message'.  This command will save the current
     message into the folder matched by `vm-auto-folder-alist', if there
     is a match.

`compose'
     The Compose button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-compose-command'.  This command is normally just an
     alias for the `vm-mail' command.  If you want the Compose button to
     do something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-compose-command' using
     either `fset' or `defun'.

`delete/undelete'
     The Delete/Undelete button.  If the current message is marked for
     deletion, this button displays as an Undelete button.  Otherwise
     it displays as a Delete button.

`file'
     The File button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-file-command'.  This command is normally just an alias
     for the `vm-mail' command.  If you want the File button to do
     something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-file-command' using either
     `fset' or `defun'.

`getmail'
     The Get Mail button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-getmail-command'.  This command is normally just an
     alias for the `vm-get-new-mail' command.  If you want the Get Mail
     button to do something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-getmail-command'
     using either `fset' or `defun'.

`help'
     The Helper button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-helper-command'.  This command normally just runs
     `vm-help', but it also does context specific things under certain
     conditions.  If the current message is a MIME message that needs
     decoding, the Helper button becomes the Decode MIME button.  If the
     current folder has an autosave file that appears to be the result
     of an Emacs or system crash, the Helper button becomes the Recover
     button.  Clicking on the Recover button runs `vm-recover-folder',
     so you can recover your folder from an existing autosave file.

`mime'
     The Decode MIME button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-mime-command'.  This command is normally just an alias
     for the `vm-decode-mime-message' command.

`next'
     The Next button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-next-command'.  This command is normally just an alias
     for the `vm-next-message' command.  If you want the Next button to
     do something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-next-command' using either
     `fset' or `defun'.

`previous'
     The Previous button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-previous-command'.  This command is normally just an
     alias for the `vm-previous-message' command.  If you want the
     Previous button to do something else, redefine
     `vm-toolbar-previous-command' using either `fset' or `defun'.

`print'
     The Print button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-print-command'.  This command is normally just an
     alias for the `vm-print-message' command.  If you want the Print
     button to do something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-print-command'
     using either `fset' or `defun'.

`quit'
     The Quit button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-quit-command'.  This command is normally just an alias
     for the `vm-quit' command.  If you want the Quit button to do
     something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-quit-command' using either
     `fset' or `defun'.

`reply'
     The Reply button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-reply-command'.  This command is normally just an
     alias for the `vm-reply-include-text' command.  If you want the
     Reply button to do something else, redefine
     `vm-toolbar-reply-command' using either `fset' or `defun'.

`visit'
     The Visit button.  Clicking on this button runs the command
     `vm-toolbar-visit-command'.  This command is normally just an
     alias for the `vm-visit-folder' command.  If you want the Visit
     button to do something else, redefine `vm-toolbar-visit-command'
     using either `fset' or `defun'.

`nil'
     If nil appears in the list, it must appear exactly once.  The
     buttons associated with symbols that appear after nil in the list
     will be display flushright for top and bottom toolbars, and
     flushbottom for left and right toolbars.

   If an positive integer appears in the the `vm-use-toolbar' list, it
specifies the number of pixels of blank space to display between the
button that comes before and the button that comes after the integer.

   The variable `vm-toolbar-orientation' controls on which side of the
frame the toolbar is displayed.  E.g.

     (setq vm-toolbar-orientation 'top)

causes the toolbar to be displayed at the top of the frame.  The `top'
in the example can be replaced with `bottom', `right' and `left' to
make the toolbar appear in those places instead.

   VM finds the images for the toolbar in the directory specified by
`vm-toolbar-pixmap-directory'.  This variable should already be set
properly by whoever installed VM on your system, so you should not need
to set it.

16 Menus
********

VM uses Emacs' menu bar and pop-up menus when they are available to
give you access to more of VM's commands.  By default VM puts a context
sensitive pop-up menu on mouse button 3 (usually the rightmost mouse
button).  If you don't want this menu, set the variable
`vm-popup-menu-on-mouse-3' to nil.

   If you set `vm-use-menus' to nil, VM will not generate a menu bar
for VM folder buffers and VM won't use pop-up menus either.  If you set
`vm-use-menus' to `1', VM will add a single `VM' entry to the existing
menu bar instead of using the whole menu bar for its purposes.  That
single entry will have all the VM command submenus under it.

   To make VM use the whole menu bar, you must set variable
`vm-use-menus' to a list of symbols.  The symbols and the order in
which they are listed determine which menus will be in the menu bar and
how they are ordered.  Valid symbol values are:
`dispose'
     This is menu of commands that are commonly used to dispose of a
     message.  E.g. reply, print, save, delete.

`emacs'
     This is actually a menu button that causes the menu bar to change
     to the global Emacs menu bar.  On that menu bar you will find a VM
     button that will return you to the VM menu bar.

`folder'
     This is a menu of folder related commands.  You can visit a
     folder, save a folder, quit a folder and so on.

`help'
     This is a menu of commands that provide information for you if you
     don't know what to do next.

`label'
     This is a menu of commands that let you add and remove message
     labels from messages.

`mark'
     This is a menu of commands that you can use to mark and unmark
     messages based on various criteria.  *Note Marking Messages::.

`motion'
     This is a menu of commands to move around inside messages and
     inside folders.

`send'
     This is a menu of commands you use to compose and send messages.

`sort'
     This is a menu of commands to sort a folder by various criteria.

`undo'
     This is a menu button that invokes the `vm-undo' command.

`virtual'
     This is a menu of commands that let you visit and create virtual
     folders.

`nil'
     If nil appears in the list, it should appear exactly once.  All
     menus after nil in the list will be displayed flushright in the
     menu bar.

17 Faces
********

VM uses Emacs faces to emphasize text in the folder and summary
buffers.  Instead of defining VM specific faces, VM's face usage is
controlled by customization variables that can point to faces.  This
allows you to use standard Emacs faces, or to create your own.  So when
you want to change which face is used, write code like this:

     (setq vm-summary-highlight-face 'bold-italic)

In the summary buffer, VM displays the summary entry for the current
message using the face specified by the `vm-summary-highlight-face'
variable.  The value of this variable should be a symbol that names a
face, or nil which means don't display the summary entry of the current
message in a special way.

   The variable `vm-mouse-track-summary' controls whether summary
entries are highlighted when the mouse pointer passes over them.  The
highlighting is done using the standard Emacs `highlight' face.

   In the folder buffer, the header contents of headers matched by the
`vm-highlighted-header-regexp' variable are displayed using the face
named by `vm-highlighted-header-face'.  This variable is ignored under
XEmacs if `vm-use-lucid-highlighting' is non-`nil'.  The XEmacs
`highlight-headers' package is used instead.  See the documentation for
the function `highlight-headers' to find out how to customize header
highlighting using this package.

   URL's that occur in message bodies are displayed using the face
named by `vm-highlight-url-face'.  Searching for URLs in a large
message can take a long time.  Since URLs often occur near the
beginning and near the end of messages, VM offers a way to search just
those parts of a message for URLs.  The variable `vm-url-search-limit'
specifies how much of a message to search.  If `vm-url-search-limit'
has a positive numeric value N, VM will search the first N / 2
characters and the last N / 2 characters in the message for URLs.

   The face named by `vm-mime-button-face' is used to display the
textual buttons that trigger the display of MIME objects.

18 Using the Mouse
******************

VM uses the following layout for the mouse buttons in the folder and
summary buffers.

button-1 (left button usually)
     Unchanged.

button-2 (middle button usually)
     Activate.  If you click on a summary entry, that message will be
     selected and become the current message.  If you click on a
     highlighted URL in the body of a message, that URL will be sent to
     the browser specified by `vm-url-browser'.

button-3 (right button usually)
     Context Menu.  If the mouse pointer is over the contents of the
     From header, button-3 pops up a menu of actions that can be taken
     using the author of the message as a parameter.  For instance, you
     may want to create a virtual folder containing all the messages in
     the current folder written by this author.  If the mouse pointer
     is over the contents of the Subject header, a menu of actions to
     be performed on the current message's subject is produced.  If
     button-3 is clicked over a highlighted URL, a menu of Web browsers
     is produced.  Otherwise the normal VM mode specific menu is
     produced.

   In mail composition buffers only mouse button-3 is affected.
Context sensitive menus are produced when that button is clicked.


File: vm.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Bugs,  Prev: Using the Mouse,  Up: Top

19 Hooks
********

VM has many hook variables that allow you to run functions when certain
events occur.  Here is a list of the hooks and when they are run.  (If
you don't write Emacs-Lisp programs you can skip this chapter.)

`vm-select-new-message-hook'
     List of hook functions called every time a message with the "new"
     attribute is made to be the current message.  When the hooks are
     run, the current buffer will be the folder containing the message
     and the start and end of the message will be bracketed by
     (point-min) and (point-max).

`vm-select-unread-message-hook'
     List of hook functions called every time a message with the
     "unread" attribute is made to be the current message.  When the
     hooks are run, the current buffer will be the folder containing
     the message and the start and end of the message will be bracketed
     by (point-min) and (point-max).

`vm-select-message-hook'
     List of hook functions called every time a message is made to be
     the current message.  When the hooks are run, the current buffer
     will be the folder containing the message and the start and end of
     the message will be bracketed by (point-min) and (point-max).

`vm-arrived-message-hook'
     List of hook functions called once for each message gathered from
     the system mail spool, or from another folder with
     `vm-get-new-mail', or from a digest with `vm-burst-digest'.  When
     the hooks are run, the current buffer will be the folder
     containing the message and the start and end of the message will
     be bracketed by (point-min) and (point-max).

`vm-spooled-mail-waiting-hook'
     List of functions called when VM first notices mail is spooled for
     a folder.  The folder buffer will be current when the hooks are
     run.

`vm-arrived-messages-hook'
     List of hook functions called after VM has gathered a group of
     messages from the system mail spool, or from another folder with
     `vm-get-new-mail', or from a digest with `vm-burst-digest'.  When
     the hooks are run, the new messages will have already been added
     to the message list but may not yet appear in the summary.  When
     the hooks are run the current buffer will be the folder containing
     the messages.

`vm-reply-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created for a reply.  VM runs this hook and then
     runs `vm-mail-mode-hook' before leaving you in the Mail mode
     buffer.

`vm-forward-message-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created to forward a message.  VM runs this hook
     and then runs `vm-mail-mode-hook' before leaving the user in the
     Mail mode buffer.

`vm-resend-bounced-message-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created to resend a bounced message.  VM runs this
     hook and then runs `vm-mail-mode-hook' before leaving you in the
     Mail mode buffer.

`vm-resend-message-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created to resend a message.  VM runs this hook
     and then runs `vm-mail-mode-hook' before leaving you in the Mail
     mode buffer.

`vm-send-digest-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created to send a digest.  VM runs this hook and
     then runs `m-mail-mode-hook' before leaving you in the Mail mode
     buffer.

`vm-mail-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created to send a non specialized message, i.e. a
     message that is not a reply, forward, digest, etc.  VM runs this
     hook and then runs `vm-mail-mode-hook' before leaving you in the
     Mail mode buffer.

`vm-summary-update-hook'
     List of hook functions called just after VM updates an existing
     entry in a folder summary buffer.

`vm-summary-redo-hook'
     List of hook functions called just after VM adds or deletes
     entries from a folder summary buffer.

`vm-visit-folder-hook'
     List of hook functions called just after VM visits a folder.  It
     doesn't matter if the folder buffer already exists, this hook is
     run each time `vm' or `vm-visit-folder' is called interactively.
     It is _not_ run after `vm-mode' is called.

`vm-retrieved-spooled-mail-hook'
     List of hook functions called just after VM has retrieved a group
     of messages from your system mailbox(es).  When these hooks are
     run, the messages have been added to the folder buffer but not the
     message list or summary.  When the hooks are run, the current
     buffer will be the folder where the messages were incorporated.

`vm-edit-message-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run just before a message is edited.
     This is the last thing `vm-edit-message' does before leaving you
     in the edit buffer.

`vm-mail-mode-hook'
     List of hook functions to be run after a Mail mode composition
     buffer has been created.  This is the last thing VM does before
     leaving you in the Mail mode buffer.

`vm-mode-hook'
     List of hook functions to run when a buffer enters `vm-mode'.
     These hook functions should generally be used to set key bindings
     and local variables.

`vm-mode-hooks'
     Old name for `vm-mode-hook'.  Supported for backward compatibility.
     You should use the new name.

`vm-summary-mode-hook'
     List of hook functions to run when a VM summary buffer is created.
     The current buffer will be that buffer when the hooks are run.

`vm-summary-mode-hooks'
     Old name for `vm-summary-mode-hook'.  Supported for backward
     compatibility.  You should use the new name.

`vm-virtual-mode-hook'
     List of hook functions to run when a VM virtual folder buffer is
     created.  The current buffer will be that buffer when the hooks
     are run.

`vm-presentation-mode-hook'
     List of hook functions to run when a VM presentation buffer is
     created.  The current buffer will be the new presentation buffer
     when the hooks are run.  Presentation buffers are used to display
     messages when some type of decoding must be done to the message to
     make it presentable.  E.g. MIME decoding.

`vm-quit-hook'
     List of hook functions to run when you quit VM.  This applies to
     any VM quit command.

`vm-summary-pointer-update-hook'
     List of hook functions to run when the VM summary pointer is
     updated.  When the hooks are run, the current buffer will be the
     summary buffer.

`vm-display-buffer-hook'
     List of hook functions that are run every time VM wants to display
     a buffer.  When the hooks are run, the current buffer will be the
     buffer that VM wants to display.  The hooks are expected to select
     a window and VM will display the buffer in that window.

     If you use display hooks, you should not use VM's built-in window
     configuration system as the result is likely to be confusing.

`vm-undisplay-buffer-hook'
     List of hook functions that are run every time VM wants to remove
     a buffer from the display.  When the hooks are run, the current
     buffer will be the buffer that VM wants to disappear.  The hooks
     are expected to do the work of removing the buffer from the
     display.  The hook functions should not kill the buffer.

     If you use undisplay hooks, you should not use VM's built-in
     window configuration system as the result is likely to be
     confusing.

`vm-iconify-frame-hook'
     List of hook functions that are run whenever VM iconifies a frame.

`vm-menu-setup-hook'
     List of hook functions that are run just after all menus are
     initialized.

`vm-mime-display-function'
     If non-`nil', this should name a function to be called inside
     `vm-decode-mime-message' to do the MIME display of the current
     message.  The function is called with no arguments, and at the
     time of the call the current buffer will be the "presentation
     buffer" for the folder, which is a temporary buffer that VM uses
     for the display of MIME messages.  A copy of the current message
     will be in the presentation buffer at that time.  The normal work
     that `vm-decode-mime-message' would do is not done, because this
     function is expected to subsume all of it.

`vm-mail-send-hook'
     List of hook functions to call just before sending a message.  The
     hooks are run after confirming that you want to send the message
     (see `vm-confirm-mail-send' but before MIME encoding and FCC
     processing.

`mail-yank-hooks'
     Hooks called after a message is yanked into a mail composition
     buffer.

     (This hook is deprecated, you should use mail-citation-hook
     instead.)

     The value of this hook is a list of functions to be run.  Each
     hook function can find the newly yanked message between point and
     mark.  Each hook function should return with point and mark around
     the yanked message.

     See the documentation for `vm-yank-message' to see when VM will run
     these hooks.

`mail-citation-hook'
     Hook for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail buffer.
     Each hook function can find the citation between (point) and (mark
     t).  And each hook function should leave point and mark around the
     citation text as modified.

     If this hook is entirely empty, i.e. `nil', a default action is
     taken instead of no action.

20 Reporting Bugs
*****************

VM has a sophisticated bug reporting system in order to provide the VM
maintainers with adequate information about the state of VM when the
error situation occurred.  However, it is still important for the users
to give as full an explanation of the problem as possible.  *Note Bugs:
(emacs)Bugs.

   The command `M-x vm-submit-bug-report' should be invoked from the VM
folder buffer in which a problem is encountered.  This creates a mail
buffer with information about the state of VM pre-filled.  Insert
suitable text to explain the problem and send the bug-report message.

   For mail server-associated problems dealing with POP/IMAP spool files
or POP/IMAP folders, the cause of the problem might be in the
interaction with the mail server.  To identify the cause, it may be
necessary for the VM maintainer to look at the server interactions
during the problem occurrence.  To capture the server interactions, run
`vm-pop-start-bug-report'/`vm-imap-start-bug-report' before the problem
occurrence and `vm-pop-submit-bug-report' /`vm-imap-submit-bug-report'
after the problem occurrence.  All the server interactions during the
interval are captured and automatically included in the bug-report.

21 History and Administration
*****************************

VM was developed by Kyle Jones, starting in early 1989.  The first
public release of VM was version 4.10, released in June of that year.
The original development environment was GNU Emacs 18.52.

   The copyright for the code was retained by Kyle Jones.  Hence, the
package was never included GNU releases, which only contain code
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation.  However, Lucid/XEmacs
shipped VM starting with version 19.9.  The other users obtained VM from
the Wonderworks web site, which hosted Kyle Jones's work.  The home page
of VM at this site is `http://www.wonderworks.com/vm'.

   The last version released by Kyle Jones was 7.19, in September 2004,
which can be found on the Wonderworks web site and its mirror sites.

   After this release, Robert Widhopf-Fenk picked up the maintenance of
VM, by releasing a series of patches under a separate distribution.  He
also acquired a number of add-on's contributed by various developers,
including himself, and included them in his distribution.  Kyle Jones
agreed to hand over the maintenance of VM to Robert Fenk in February,
2007.  Further releases were made by Robert Fenk under the `8.0.x'
series.

   All these releases are available from the new project page of VM
hosted by Savannah, at the URL
`http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/viewmail/'.  According to the
project page, "this site exists to continue VM development after
version 7.19 as a community project."

   Currently, VM is maintained by a "VM Development Team," consisting of
Robert Widhopf-Fenk, Ulrich Mller and Uday S Reddy.  Other potential
members are warmly welcomed.  Robert Fenk has been inactive since
November, 2008 but he continues to be an official member of the team.
The new releases made by the team are numbered `8.1.0' and up.

   The project code base is maintained at the Launchpad web site
`http://launchpad.net/vm'.  The "VM Development Team" can be reached
here using the email address `vm@launchpad.net'.

Savannah project site
---------------------

The changes made in each of the releases is described in the `NEWS'
file, which can be found in the source code repository.  The changes
made in versions up to 7.19 are described in the `CHANGES' file.

   The `Download' link on the Savannah project page, takes you to the
downloads area where all the recent releases are available.  Under the
`Source Code' menu, the `Browse Sources Repository' takes you to the
source files, which include, among others, the `NEWS' and `CHANGES'
files mentioned above.

   If you have obtained VM through a secondary distribution that does
not include all the sources, you can browse and download the sources
from the `Source Code' menu.  The `Use Bazaar' entry in the menu takes
you to a page that lists various version of VM source code, and gives
instructions for downloading it via `Bazaar' (`bzr').

Technical support
-----------------

VM has a dedicated usenet newsgroup `gnu.emacs.vm.info' in which the
developers and the active users participate.  This is the first port of
call for getting help with VM.  The archives of the newsgroup can be
found at the Google Groups site
`http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.vm.info/topics'.

   A second newsgroup `gnu.emacs.vm.bug' is dedicated to discussing
bugs or potential bugs in VM.  However, this is a place for discussion,
not reporting bugs or getting them fixed.

   The easiest way to report bugs that need fixing is to use the command
`M-x vm-submit-bug-report' within VM.  This prepares an email message
by including a state of your VM program which will allow the developers
to reproduce your problem.  (Potentially sensitive information such as
passwords are not included in this state.)  Please include a detailed
description of the problem and how it arose.  The developers may need
to ask you for further information or ask you to try alternative
approaches to narrow down the problem.

   The best way to report bugs is via the Launchpad bug tacker.  See
below.

Get Involved
------------

VM is now supported and maintained by the user community.  So, as an
active user, your participation is key to keep the project going.

   Consider registering as a user of the Launchpad development site
`http://launchpad.net/vm'.  This allows you to communicate with the
developers and other users using a private Launchpad email address.  In
particular, you can contribute bug reports and participate in the bug
report discussions.

   You can download the development versions of VM and act as an "alpha"
tester.  This will allow you to shape the new developments and features
and make suggestions that will be valuable to the developers.

   To download the development version, identify the "branch" that you
would like to download, and use Bazaar version control system with an
appropriate Launchpad URL.  For example, the command `bzr get lp:vm'
can be used to download the main development branch.

   You can also make change to the branch you have downloaded, and
submit them to the developers for inclusion in the project.  The
`README' file in the distribution explains how to do this.
Alternatively, you can create a separate branch in your own space on
the Launchpad web site, and submit your changes to that branch.  The
developers can review and merge your branch with the main development
when your changes are ready.

22 VM Internals
***************

This section gives a sketchy overview of the VM internals for the
developers/programmers.

* Menu:

* Folder Internals::      Structure of the folders
* Message Internals::     Structure of the message data structure


File: vm.info,  Node: Folder Internals,  Next: Message Internals,  Up: Internals

22.1 Folder Internals
=====================

By default, VM stores mail folders in the Unix `mbox' format, described
in the RFC 4155 specification of the Internet Engineering Task Force.
In this format, the mail folder is a text file consisting of a sequence
of messages, with each message consisting of a series of headers
followed by a message body.  The beginning of each message is
delineated by a separator line starting with the string "From " and the
end by a blank line.  To make sure that such a line exists, VM adds its
own header line of the form "From VM ..." where the "..."  records the
time at which VM first saw the message.  The format of the individual
messages is as per the RFC 2822 specification, except that Line-Feed
characters may be used to delineate the end of lines in the "Unix"
format.

   In addition to the Unix mbox format (which is called the `From_'
format), VM also handles the MMDF format and two versions of the System
V Unix format and the Emacs Rmail's Babyl format.  The variable
`vm-folder-type' stores the type of the folder being used.

   To every message, VM adds a header with the field name
"X-VM-v5-Data:" and stores in it the information about the message it
wishes to remember between sessions.  This header line is used merely
for speed of processing.  If, for any reason, a VM folder is corrupted,
it is safe to delete all the X-VM-v5-Data headers, and VM will generate
them afresh when the folder is visited.

   The first message of the VM folder file contains additional headers
that VM uses for remembering information between sessions.

   * X-VM-Bookmark. This header stores the position of the cursor, as a
     message number, in effect when VM saved the folder.  Upon
     revisiting the folder, VM attempts to put the cursor back at this
     position.

   * X-VM-Last-Modified.

   * X-VM-Message-Order.  This header lists the order in which the
     messages should be listed.

   * X-VM-Labels. This header lists the message labels that have been
     used in the folder.

   * X-VM-VHeader. This header lists the visible headers that should be
     displayed in message listings.

   * X-VM-Summary-Format.  This header stores the format string for the
     summary lines.

   * X-VM-POP-Retrieved. This header lists all the messages that have
     been retrieved from POP servers together with the identifying
     information for the POP servers.  VM refrains from retrieving these
     messages again in future in order to avoid duplication.

   * X-VM-IMAP-Retrieved. This header lists all the messages that have
     been retrieved from IMAP servers together with the identifying
     information for the IMAP servers.  VM refrains from retrieving
     these messages again in future in order to avoid duplication.

   Internal to Emacs, VM stores the folder as simply a text buffer.
However, it remembers a variety of data about the message contents in
the buffer through internal variables.

   * `vm-message-list'.  A list of message data structures for all the
     messages in the buffer.

   * `vm-message-pointer'.  A sublist of vm-message-list starting from
     the current message that the cursor is on.  So, the first element
     of vm-message-pointer is the current message.

   * `vm-last-message-pointer'.  Whenever the cursor is moved, the
     previous value of vm-message-pointer is remembered in this
     variable.

   * `vm-folder-type'.  The type of the current folder indicating how
     the messages are stored: one of 'babyl, 'From_, 'BellFrom_,
     'From_-with-Content-Length and 'mmdf.

   * `vm-folder-access-method'.  The method for accessing the server
     message store: 'pop for pop-folders as well as local folders
     retrieving messages from POP servers, 'imap for imap-folders as
     well as local folders retrieving messages from IMAP servers, and
     nil for all other folders.

   * `vm-folder-access-data'.  A vector of data for accessing the server
     message store.  The first two elements of the vector are the
     maildrop specification for the mail server and a reference to the
     process connecting to the mail server.  For the 'pop access
     method, that is all there is.  But, for the 'imap access method,
     the vector has 9 other entries detailing various pieces of data
     about the IMAP server.

   * `vm-virtual-folder-definition'.  If the current folder is virtual,
     then this variable holds the data constituting its definition.

   * `vm-real-buffers'.  If the current folder is virtual, then this
     variable is a list of all the real folder buffers involved in
     constructing it.

   * `vm-virtual-buffers'.  A list of all the virtual folder buffers
     that the current buffer is involved in.

22.2 Message Internals
======================

The message data structure is a vector containing various pieces of
data:

   * Location data.  This data about the location of the various parts
     of the message in the folder buffer is calculated after a folder
     is loaded and parsed.

        * start.  The starting position of the message, at which a
          leading separator line begins.

        * headers. The position in the folder buffer where the headers
          of the message start.

        * vheaders.  The position in the folder buffer where the
          visible headers of the message start.  (The headers are
          rearranged in such a way that all the visible headers are
          towards the end of the headers region.)

        * text. The position in the folder buffer where the text of the
          message starts.

        * text-end. The position in the folder buffer where the text of
          the message ends

        * end. The position in the folder buffer where the message ends.

   * Soft data.  This vector contains other calculated data about the
     message.

        * number. The message number as an integer.

        * padded number. The message number as a padded string.

        * mark. Flag that indicates if the message has been marked (via
          `vm-mark-message').

        * su-start. The position in the summary buffer where the
          summary line of the message starts.

        * su-end.  The position in the summary buffer where the summary
          line of the message ends.

        * real-message-sym.  If the message is in a virtual folder,
          then its corresponding "real message" is the underlying
          message in another folder which is described by a message
          data structure similar to the current one.  The real message
          data structures are interned in an obarray and represented by
          "symbols".  This field stores the symbol representing the
          real message of the current message.

        * reverse-link.  Link to the previous message in the message
          list.

        * message-type.  A symbol indicating the type of the message
          according to its folder type, one of `BellFrom_', `From_' and
          `From_-with-Content-Length'.

        * message-id-number.  The unique id of the message.

        * buffer. The folder buffer of the message.

        * thread-indentation. Indentation level of the message in its
          message thread.

        * babyl-frob-flag.

        * saved-virtual-attributes.  Saved attributes if the message
          switched from unmirrored to mirrored.

        * saved-virtual-mirror-data.  Saved mirror data, if the message
          was switched from unmirrored to mirrored.

        * virtual-summary.  Summary for unmirrored virtual message.

        * mime-layout.  MIME layout information; types, ids, positions,
          etc of all MIME entities.

        * mime-encoded-header-flag. Flag that indicates if the headers
          of the message are MIME encoded.

        * su-summary-mouse-track-overlay.

        * message-access-method.  The access-method to be used for the
          message, inherited from its real folder.

   * Attributes.  All the hard-wired message attributes are stored in
     this vector.  They also get saved as part of the `X-VM-v5-Data'
     header field when the folder is saved to disk.

        * new-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message is "new".

        * unread-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message is unread.

        * deleted-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been
          deleted.

        * filed-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been filed.

        * replied-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been
          replied to.

        * written-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been saved.

        * forwarded-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been
          forwarded.

        * edited-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been edited.

        * redistributed-flag.  Flag to indicate if the message has been
          redistributed.

   * Cached Data.  The data that is cached for the message and stored
     in the folder on disk as the `X-VM-v5-Data' header field.  Even
     though this vector is only supposed to have data that can be
     calculated from the message itself, the fields pop-uidl, imap-uid
     and imap-uid-validity form an exception.  They are really hard
     data that cannot be calculated from anything else.

        * byte-count.  The size of the message in bytes.

        * weekday, monthday, month, year, hour, zone.  Data indicating
          the date of the message.

        * full-name.  The full name of the author of the message.

        * from.  The email address of the author of the message.

        * message-id.  The unique id of the message.

        * line-count. The number of lines in the message.

        * subject.  The subject string of the message.

        * vheaders-regexp.  A regular expression that can be used to
          find the start of the already ordered headers.

        * to.  Addresses of the recipients of the message in a comma
          separated string.

        * to-names. The full names of the recipients in a comma
          separated string.  Addresses are used if full names are not
          available.

        * month-number.  Numeric month of the sent date.

        * sortable-datestring.  Date string of the sent date for
          sorting purposes.

        * sortable-subject.  The subject string for sorting purposes.
          (Prefixes such as "re:" are removed.)

        * summary.  The summary string for the message.

        * parent.  The parent of the message in the message thread,
          which is another message data structure.

        * references.  Message IDs listed in the References header of
          the message.

        * headers-to-be-retrieved.  Flag that indicates whether the
          headers of the message have not been retrieved from the mail
          server (for POP or IMAP folders).

        * body-to-be-retrieved.  Flag that indicates whether the body
          of the message has not been retrieved from the mail server.

        * pop-uidl.  The UIDL id of the message on the POP server.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
