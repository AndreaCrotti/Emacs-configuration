This file lists the bugs, feature requests and wishes for future versions
of VM.  If you are missing anything please let me know!

******************************************************************************
EVERGREENS

There are some things which probably will never be fixed ...

 * Update the info file. News should also be there not in the NEWS file?

 * Cleanup and reorganize the code.

 * Better doc strings: VM has nearly none in the core, just my own extensions
   have been documented properly using "M-x checkdoc RET".

 * Enable sane extensions and configurations: The default should satisfy most
   people, but still allow one to disable what they dislike. 

 * Integrate more extensions from others into the core.

******************************************************************************
BUGS

The bugs which should be fixed before the next release:

 * Syncing with Mozilla-Status may corrupt folder

The bugs that remain unsolved:

 * Sometimes the cursor is not restored correctly in GNU Emacs when visiting
   a folder multiple times during an Emacs session.

 * VM is dead slow in marking/deleting/... when a folder has thousands of 
   messages.

******************************************************************************
ROADMAP

The features planed for one of the next releases.  

The order hints on the priority, but it is no gurantee.

 * Folding of threads in the summary

 * Display draft status in the modeline. (partially done)

 * Break up the customize stuff into more and smaller sub categories.

 * GNU Emacs: does not highlight attachment buttons in compositions

 * Merge changes from the Debian package.

 * Some of the user defined summary functions should become internal ones.
   E.g.: has-attachments, text/html, size, draft, ...

 * Better HTML support for both displaying and replying, but probably not for
   composition as there is no urge to surrender here!  There should be a test 
   for w3m-emacs, w3, lynx, w3m and the best method should be selected by 
   default if not configured by the user.  

   HTML only messages should be converted to mixed/alternative parts by 
   vm-assimilate-html-message.  vm-mime-show-alternatives should probably 
   be smart enough to display all but the chosen part as button.

   "D" should switch between mixed/alternative parts and the undecoded
   resp. button representation.

 * Click in mailto: link does not work when being used from w3 buffers.

 * Virtual selectors matching on specific mime parts, e.g.
   (vm-vs-text regexp): matching only text parts and those which can be
      converted to text. 
   (vm-vs-attachment regexp):  matching the disposition of parts

 * Improved (i)search support: Only text parts and certain headers should be
   searched and it should also work for virtual folders.  We might utilize
   virtual folder selectors here. [1]

 * Better IMAP support, i.e. just fetch headers, sync, offline, search.  It is
   really bad now and thus I do use Thunderbird at work!

 * Maildir support: It is a nice format and possibly can fix the problem of
   huge mail folders, as VM must not read the whole buffer into memory, just
   the index.  Also it would allow for using external indexing tools like
   http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/ and make folders really virtual.

 * Virtual folders everywhere, i.e. only one physical folder.  VM should
   not read the folder into a buffer, but only query relevant messages from
   an maildb-backend.

 * S/MIME PKI support.
 
******************************************************************************
REST

The unsorted and remaining ones.

 * Marking + Delete is dead slow on folders with many (>2000) messages.

 * Shortcut to expunge a single message.

From EU

 * Fix bugs when marking threads by "M T".  Sometimes it misses some messages,
   IMHO ones of broken MUAs not setting the References: header, but hey we
   cannot fix them so let's work around them.

 * for text/alternative messages, when the plain text part is
   displayed internally, [add variable that will allow to] show icon
   for the html (or rich text) part, which will allow to delete it
   easily using $d.  I now have to edit these by hand...

 * The binding of mouse-3 overrides the usual usage of mouse-3 which
   is very useful.  An option to allow binding this menu to another
   key (C-mouse-3?) would be great.

 * when attachments appear with no empty line separating them from the
   text, the attachment icon appears on the same line as the text
   before it.  this results in poor appearance (I think), Would be
   much nicer to show the attachment icon on a separate line, rather
   than continued on the last text line as now.

 * Typing h when in the presentation window makes vm display only a
   single windows with headers rather than adding a headers window to
   the presentation mode window. (when in vm, change to presentation
   buffer, type C-x1 and then h"

 * When reading mail I have the frame divided into three windows:
   headers, presentation and BBDB.  When replying from the header
   window, the reply window just replaces the headers window, leaving
   the presentation window and the BBDB window unchanged.  The
   resulting reply window is too small...  would be good to have it
   replace all three windows (headers, presentation, BBDB) until the
   reply is sent.
