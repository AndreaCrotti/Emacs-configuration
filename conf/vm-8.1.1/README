BUGS

Please report bugs in VM using the VM function
	   M-x vm-submit-bug-report
This function formats an email report including the entire state of VM
which can be used to diagnose and fix the bug.  Please include
information about how to reproduce the problem.

Please report any problems or bugs otherwise they cannot be fixed!

If you are not sure that the problem is a bug or that it could be of
general importance to other users, you are welcome to discuss it on
the USENET groups gnu.emacs.vm.bugs or gnu.emacs.vm.info!  However, it
is not always possible to diagnose problems without full information
about your VM settings.  So, filing a bug report is necessary.

*******************************************************************************

The new homepage of VM is at http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/ hosted by

Eventually, we may migrate to a single site for both the facilities.
