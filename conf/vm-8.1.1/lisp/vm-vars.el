  "*If non-nil this variable's value should be a list of strings
or a list of lists.

If the value is a list of strings, the strings should name files
that VM will check for incoming mail instead of the default place
VM thinks your system mailbox is.  Mail will be moved from these
mailboxes to your primary inbox as specified by `vm-primary-inbox',
using `vm-crash-box' as a waystation.

If the value is a list of lists, each sublist should be of the form

    (INBOX SPOOLNAME CRASHBOX)

INBOX, SPOOLNAME and CRASHBOX are all strings.

INBOX is the folder where you want your new mail to be moved when
you type 'g' (running `vm-get-new-mail') in VM.  It is where you
will read the mail.

SPOOLNAME is where the mail system leaves your incoming mail,
e.g. /var/spool/mail/kyle.  It can also be a mailbox
specification of the form, \"po:USER\", where USER is a user
name.  VM will pass this specification to the movemail program.
It is up to movemail to interpret it and figure out where to find
your mailbox.  Some systems use special authentication methods that
are only accessible via the movemail program.

SPOOLNAME can also be a POP maildrop.

    A POP maildrop specification has the following format:

       \"pop:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD\"
    or
       \"pop-ssl:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD\"
    or
       \"pop-ssh:HOST:PORT:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD\"

    The second form is used to speak POP over an SSL connection.
    You must have the stunnel program installed and the variable
    `vm-stunnel-program' naming it in order for POP over SSL to
    work.  The SSL version of the POP server will not use the
    same port as the non-SSL version.

    The third form is used to speak POP over an SSH connection.
    You must have the ssh program installed and the variable
    `vm-ssh-program' must name it in order for POP over SSH to
    work.  SSH must be able to authenticate without a password,
    which means you must be using either .shosts authentication
    or RSA authentication.

    HOST is the host name of the POP server

    PORT is the TCP port number to connect to.  This should
    normally be 110, unless you're using POP over SSL in which
    case the stanard port is 995.

    USER is the user name sent to the server.

    PASSWORD is the secret shared by you and the server for
    authentication purposes.  How is it used depends on the value of
    the AUTH parameter.  If the PASSWORD is \"*\", VM will prompt
    you for the password the first time you try to retrieve mail from
    maildrop.  If the password is valid, VM will not ask you for the
    password again during this Emacs session.

    AUTH is the authentication method used to convince the server you
    should have access to the maildrop.  Acceptable values are
    \"pass\", \"rpop\" and \"apop\".  For \"pass\", the PASSWORD is sent to
    the server with the POP PASS command.  For \"rpop\", the PASSWORD
    should be the string to be sent to the server via the RPOP
    command.  In this case the string is not really a secret;
    authentication is done by other means.  For \"apop\", an MD5 digest
    of the PASSWORD appended to the server timestamp will be sent to
    the server with the APOP command.  In order to use \"apop\" you
    will have to set the value of `vm-pop-md5-program' appropriately to
    point at the program that will generate the MD5 digest that VM
    needs.

SPOOLNAME can also be an IMAP maildrop.

    An IMAP maildrop specification has the following format:

       \"imap:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD\"
    or
       \"imap-ssl:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD\"
    or
       \"imap-ssh:HOST:PORT:MAILBOX:AUTH:USER:PASSWORD\"

    The second form is used to speak IMAP over an SSL connection.
    You must have the stunnel program installed and the variable
    `vm-stunnel-program' naming it in order for IMAP over SSL to
    work.

    The third form is used to speak IMAP over an SSH connection.
    You must have the ssh program installed and the variable
    `vm-ssh-program' must name it in order for IMAP over SSH to
    work.  SSH must be able to authenticate without a password,
    which means you must be using .shosts authentication or
    public key user authentication.

    HOST is the host name of the IMAP server.

    PORT is the TCP port number to connect to.  This should
    normally be 143.  For IMAP over SSL, the standard port is
    993.  There is no special port for IMAP over SSH.

    MAILBOX is the name of the mailbox on the IMAP server.  Should
    be \"inbox\", to access your default IMAP maildrop on the
    server.

    AUTH is the authentication method used to convince the server
    you should have access to the maildrop.  Acceptable values
    are \"preauth\", \"login\" and \"cram-md5\".  \"preauth\"
    causes VM to skip the authentication stage of the protocol
    with the assumption that the session was authenticated in some
    external way.  \"login\", tells VM to use the IMAP LOGIN
    command for authentication, which sends your username and
    password in cleartext to the server.  \"cram-md5\" is a
    challenge response system that convinces the server of your
    identity without transmitting your password in the clear.
    Not all servers support \"cram-md5\"; if you're not sure, ask
    your mail administrator or just try it.

    USER is the user name used with authentication methods that
    require such an identifier.  \"login\" and \"cram-md5\"
    use it currently.

    PASSWORD is the secret shared by you and the server for
    authentication purposes.  If the PASSWORD is \"*\", VM
    will prompt you for the password the first time you try to
    retrieve mail from maildrop.  If the password is valid, VM
    will not ask you for the password again during this Emacs
    session.

CRASHBOX is the temporary file that VM uses to store mail in
transit between the SPOOLNAME and the INBOX.  If the system
crashes or Emacs dies while mail is being moved, and the new
mail is not in the SPOOLNAME or the INBOX, then it will be in
the CRASHBOX.

There can be multiple entries with the same INBOX value, but a
particular SPOOLNAME should appear only once.  CRASHBOXes should
not be shared among different INBOXes, but you can use the same
CRASHBOX/INBOX pair with a different SPOOLNAME.

environmental variables MAILPATH or MAIL if either of these

The alist format is a list of lists, each sublist having the form

 (TYPE PROGRAM ARG ARG ... )

or

TYPE is a string specifying a MIME type or type/subtype pair.
For example \"text\" or \"image/jpeg\".  If a top-level type is
listed without a subtype, all subtypes of that type are assumed
to be included.

In the first form, PROGRAM is a string naming a program to run to
display an object.  Any ARGS will be passed to the program as
arguments.  The octets that compose the object will be written
into a temporary file and the name of the file can be inserted
into an ARG string by writing %f.  In earlier versions of VM the
filename was always added as the last argument; as of VM 6.49 this
is only done if %f does not appear in any of the ARG strings.
The filename inserted by %f will be quoted by `shell-quote-argument'
and thus no single quotes should be used, i.e. do not use the following 
\"...'%f'...\".

If the COMMAND-LINE form is used, the program and its arguments
are specified as a single string and that string is passed to the
shell for execution.  Since the command line will be passed to
the shell, you can use shell variables and redirection if needed.
As with the PROGRAM/ARGS form, the name of the temporary file
that contains the MIME object will be appended to the command
line if %f does not appear in the command line string.

In either the PROGRAM/ARG or COMMAND-LINE forms, all the
program and argument strings will have any %-specifiers in
them expanded as described in the documentation for the
variable `vm-mime-button-format-alist'.  The only difference
is that %f refers to the temporary file VM creates to store
the object to be displayed, not the filename that the sender
may have associated with the attachment.

Example:

 (setq vm-mime-external-content-types-alist

	 (\"text/html\" 	\"netscape\")
	 (\"image/gif\" 	\"xv\")

START-CHARSET is a string specifying a MIME charset.

COMMAND-LINE is a string giving a command line to be passed to

When VM does not display a MIME object immediately, it displays a
button or tag line in its place that describes the object and what you
have to do to display it.  The value of `vm-mime-button-format-alist'
determines the format of the text in those buttons.

The format of the list is

  ((TYPE . FORMAT) (TYPE . FORMAT) ...)

The list is searched sequentially and the FORMAT corresponding to
the first TYPE that matches the type of the button's object is
used.

TYPE should be a string specifying a top level type or a type/subtype
pair.  If a top-level type is listed without a subtype, all subtypes
of that type are assumed to be included.

FORMAT should be a string specifying the text of the button.  The
string should not include a newline.  The string may contain the
printf-like `%' conversion specifiers which substitute information
about the MIME object into the button.

Recognized specifiers are:
   a - the default action of the button.  E.g. \"display image\" for images,
       \"display text\" for text objects and so on.
   c - the character set of the object.  Usually only specified
       for text objects.  Displays as \"us-ascii\" if the MIME object
       does not specifiy a character set.
   d - the content description of the object taken from the
       Content-Description header, if present.  If the header
       isn't present, a generic description is provided.
   e - the content transfer encoding, either \"base64\" or
       \"quoted-printable\".
   f - the suggested file name to save the object into, as
       specified either in the Content-Disposition header, or the
       \"name\" parameter for objects of type \"application\".
   k - how to activate the button.  Usually \"Press RETURN\" or
       \"Click mouse-2\".
   n - for multipart types this is the number of bundled parts,
       messages, whatever.
   N - for message/partial objects, the part number.
   s - an empty string if %n would display \"1\", otherwise
       \"s\".
   t - the content type of the object, e.g. \"text/enriched\".
   T - for message/partial objects, the total number of expected
       parts.  \"?\" is displayed if the object doesn't specify
       the total number of parts expected.
   x - the content type of the external body of a message/external-body
       object.
   ( - starts a group, terminated by %).  Useful for specifying
       the field width and precision for the concatentation of
       group of format specifiers.  Example: \"%.25(%d, %t, %f%)\"
       specifies a maximum display width of 25 characters for the
       concatenation of the content description, content type and
       suggested file name.
   ) - ends a group.

Use %% to get a single %.

A numeric field width may be given between the `%' and the specifier;
this causes right justification of the substituted string.  A negative field
width causes left justification.

The field width may be followed by a `.' and a number specifying
the maximum allowed length of the substituted string.  If the
string is longer than this value the right end of the string is
truncated.  If the value is negative, the string is truncated on
the left instead of the right."

  "*Non-nil value should be a list of virtual folder definitions.

A virtual folder is a mapping of messages from one or more real folders
into what appears to be a single folder.  A virtual folder definition
specifies which real folders should be searched for prospective messages
and what the inclusion criteria are.

Each virtual folder definition should have the following form:

  (VIRTUAL-FOLDER-NAME
    ( (FOLDER-NAME ...)
      (SELECTOR [ARG ...]) ... )
    ... )

VIRTUAL-FOLDER-NAME is the name of the virtual folder being defined.
This is the name by which you and VM will refer to this folder.

FOLDER-NAME should be the name of a real folder.  There may be more than
one FOLDER-NAME listed, the SELECTORs within that sublist will apply to
them all.  If FOLDER-NAME is a directory, VM will assume this to mean that
all the folders in that directory should be searched.

The SELECTOR is a Lisp symbol that tells VM how to decide whether a message
from one of the folders specified by the FOLDER-NAMEs should be included
in the virtual folder.  Some SELECTORs require an argument ARG; unless
otherwise noted ARG may be omitted.

The recognized SELECTORs are:

   author          - matches message if ARG matches the author; ARG should be a
                     regular expression.
   author-or-recipient
		   - matches message if ARG matches the author of
		     the message or any of its recipients; ARG
		     should be a regular expression.
   and             - matches the message if all its argument
                     selectors match the message.  Example:
                        (and (author \"Derek McGinty\") (new))
                     matches all new messages from Derek McGinty.
                     `and' takes any number of arguments.
   any             - matches any message.
   deleted         - matches message if it is flagged for deletion.
   edited          - matches message if it has been edited.
   filed           - matches message if it has been saved with its headers.
   forwarded       - matches message if it has been forwarded using
		     a variant of `vm-forward-message' or `vm-send-digest'.
   header          - matches message if ARG matches any part of the header
                     portion of the message; ARG should be a
                     regular expression.
   header-or-text  - matches message if ARG matches any part of the
		     headers or the text portion of the message;
		     ARG should be a regular expression.
   label           - matches message if message has a label named ARG.
   less-chars-than - matches message if message has less than ARG
                     characters.  ARG should be a number.
   less-lines-than - matches message if message has less than ARG
                     lines.  ARG should be a number.
   more-chars-than - matches message if message has more than ARG
                     characters.  ARG should be a number.
   more-lines-than - matches message if message has more than ARG
                     lines.  ARG should be a number.
   marked          - matches message if it is marked, as with `vm-mark-message'.
   new             - matches message if it is new.
   not             - matches message only if its selector argument
                     does NOT match the message.  Example:
                       (not (deleted))
                     matches messages that are not deleted.
   or              - matches the message if any of its argument
                     selectors match the message.  Example:
                        (or (author \"Dave Weckl\") (subject \"drum\"))
                     matches messages from Dave Weckl or messages
                     with the word \"drum\" in their Subject header.
                     `or' takes any number of arguments.
   read            - matches message if it is neither new nor unread.
   recent	   - matches message if it is new.
   recipient       - matches message if ARG matches any part of the recipient
                     list of the message.  ARG should be a regular expression.
   redistributed   - matches message if it has been redistributed using
		     `vm-resend-message'.
   replied         - matches message if it has been replied to.
   sent-after      - matches message if it was sent after the date ARG.
                     A fully specified date looks like this:
                       \"31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT\"

                     part, with the exception of the hh:mm:ss
                     part which defaults to midnight.

   subject         - matches message if ARG matches any part of the message's
                     subject; ARG should be a regular expression.
   text            - matches message if ARG matches any part of the text
                     portion of the message; ARG should be a

   unanswered	   - matches message if it has not been replied to.
		     Same as the `unreplied' selector.
   undeleted	   - matches message if it has not been deleted.
   unedited	   - matches message if it has not been edited.
   unfiled         - matches message if it has not been saved with its
