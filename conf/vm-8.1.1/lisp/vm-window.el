;;; Code:
(defun vm-display (buffer display commands configs
		   &optional do-not-raise)
;; the clearinghouse VM display function.
;;
;; First arg BUFFER non-nil is a buffer to display or undisplay.
;; nil means there is no request to display or undisplay a
;; buffer.
;;
;; Second arg DISPLAY non-nil means to display the buffer, nil means
;; to undisplay it.  This function guarantees to display the
;; buffer if requested.  Undisplay is not guaranteed.
;;
;; Third arg COMMANDS is a list of symbols.  this-command must
;; match one of these symbols for a window configuration to be
;; applied.
;;
;; Fourth arg CONFIGS is a list of window configurations to try.
;; vm-set-window-configuration will step through the list looking
;; for an existing configuration, and apply the one it finds.
;;
;; Display is done this way:
;;  1. if the buffer is visible in an invisible frame, make that frame visible
;;  2. if the buffer is already displayed, quit
;;  3. if vm-display-buffer-hook in non-nil
;;        run the hooks
;;        use the selected window/frame to display the buffer
;;        quit
;;  4. apply a window configuration
;;        if the buffer is displayed now, quit
;;  5. call vm-display-buffer which will display the buffer.
;;
;; Undisplay is done this way:
;;  1. if the buffer is not displayed, quit
;;  2. if vm-undisplay-buffer-hook is non-nil
;;        run the hooks
;;        quit
;;  3. apply a window configuration
;;  4, if a window configuration was applied
;;        quit
;;  5. call vm-undisplay-buffer which will make the buffer
;;     disappear from at least one window/frame.
;;
;; If display/undisplay is not requested, only window
;; configuration is done, and only then if the value of
;; this-command is found in the COMMANDS list.
