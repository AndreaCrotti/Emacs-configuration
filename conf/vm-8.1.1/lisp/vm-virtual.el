(defun vm-build-virtual-message-list (new-messages &optional dont-finalize)
  "Builds a list of messages matching the virtual folder definition
stored in the variable vm-virtual-folder-definition.

If the NEW-MESSAGES argument is nil, the message list is
derived from the folders listed in the virtual folder
definition and selected by the various selectors.  The
resulting message list is assigned to vm-message-list unless
DONT-FINALIZE is non-nil.

If NEW-MESSAGES is non-nil then it is a list of messages to
be tried against the selector parts of the virtual folder
definition.  Matching messages are added to vm-message-list,
instead of replacing it.

The messages in the NEW-MESSAGES list, if any, must all be in the
same real folder.

The list of matching virtual messages is returned.

If DONT-FINALIZE is nil, in addition to vm-message-list being
set, the virtual messages are added to the virtual message
lists of their real messages, the current buffer is added to
vm-virtual-buffers list of each real folder buffer represented
in the virtual list, and vm-real-buffers is set to a list of
all the real folder buffers involved."
