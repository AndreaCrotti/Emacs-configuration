Status

  VM is currently being maintained by a 'VM development team'
  consisting of Robert Widhopf-Fenk, Ulrich Müller and Uday S Reddy.
  We continue to look for more volunteers to help with the
  maintenance.

  The version 8.1 released here has been under development for more
  than 2 years.  It was held back by Robert Fenk getting busy towards
  the end of 2008 and a long period of interregnum.  Hopefully, we
  have that behind us.  This version has major improvements on various
  fronts, especially for imap-folders.  Please read the details
  below. 

  Bug reports should be sent by using M-x vm-submit-bug-report.  Enjoy
  using VM! - Rob, Ulrich and Uday
  
VM 8.1.1 (2010-04-??)

   ** The variable vm-always-use-presentation-buffer is deprecated.
      Please remove all settings for this variable in your init file.
      The default behaviour will be to always use the presentation
      buffer.  Report any problems that might arise as a result.

    * Extended Org mode email links to handle POP and IMAP folders.
      (Use org-vm.el in the VM contrib directory until the Org mode
      distribution gets updated.)

    * Added autoloads for easy inter-operation with the Org mode.

    * Made the autoloads compatible with VM 7.19 instructions.

    * Removed a few incompatibilites with XEmacs.

    * Mode line format reverted to the original one in 7.19.  The new
      mode line format is available in the variable
      `vm-mode-line-format-robf'.  It can be installed by adding a
      vm-mode-hook. 

VM 8.1.0 (2010-03-21)

  KNOWN PROBLEMS:

    * Automatic filling is turned off for some plain text messages for
      safety reasons.  Please help us by sending us sample messages
      for which filling fails.

    * IMAP folders occasionally give spurious connection errors.
      Doing vm-get-new-mail ('g') resumes the connection.

  MAJOR NEW FEATURES:

    * Support for reading and replying to messages in HTML.

    * Full support for IMAP servers.  (See "IMPROVEMENTS for
      imap-folders" below.) 

  CHANGES:

   ** New boolean variable `vm-word-wrap-paragraphs' controls the word
      wrapping of paragraphs in messages using the longlines library.
      The variable is set to nil by default. When it is set to t,
      paragraphs are word wrapped and the value of the variable
      `vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' is immaterial (as
      long it is non-nil).  Set vm-word-wrap-paragraphs to nil to
      enable the usual filling functionality.

   ** vm-pgg is not loaded by default because it is a set up as an
      add-on.  Users should load it from their .emacs file by using
      the sequence
           (require 'vm-autoloads)
           (require 'vm-pgg)

   ** The variable `vm-mime-show-alternatives' is deprecated.  Set
      the variable `vm-mime-alternative-select-method' to 'all to
      get the same effect.

    * Moved Robert's user-defined summary functions to the core:
     - S for human readable size
     - P for indication of attachments
     - p for indication of a postponed message

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Display number of drafts and postponed messages in the modeline
      and use a more compact modeline.  To use this feature, include
      this line in your .vm file:

        (setq vm-mode-line-format vm-mode-line-format-robf)

    * The variable `vm-paragraph-fill-column', previously removed in
      earlier versions of this release, is brought back.

   ** The commands `vm-mime-save-all-attachments' and
      `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments' have been moved to the VM core
      (from vm-rfaddons).  New variables:
	 vm-mime-deletable-types 
	    (formerly `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments-types')
	 vm-mime-deletable-type-exceptions
	    (formerly `vm-mime-delete-all-attachments-types-exceptions')
	 vm-mime-savable-types
	    (formerly `vm-mime-save-all-attachments-types')
	 vm-mime-savable-type-exceptions
	    (formerly `vm-mime-save-all-attachments-types-exceptions')         
	 vm-mime-attachment-save-directory
	 vm-mime-attachment-source-directory
	 vm-mime-all-attachments-directory
      See the info file section on MIME attachments for details.

      The options for vm-rfaddons.el should not include
      `save-all-attachments' and should be removed if it is currently
      being used.  The option `take-action-on-attachments' is not
      included by default.

    * `vm-quit-no-change' offers to delete the auto-save file if there is
      one.  (This wasn't getting done due to a bug in FSF Emacs.)

    * `vm-delete-duplicate-messages' now works by comparing message ID's.
      (from Noah Friedman's vm-addons).

    * New boolean variable `vm-sort-threads-by-youngest-date' allows
      threads to be sorted by their youngest date or oldest date.

    * `vm-yank-message' function streamlined a bit.  New variable
      `vm-include-text-from-presentation' can be used to extract the
      included message text from the presentation buffer.

   ** text/html handling controlled by a new variable
      `vm-mime-text/html-handler' which is set to 'auto-select by
      default.  It causes VM to locate the best library among
      emacs-w3m, external w3m, w3 and lynx to display html
      internally.  (This replaces the earlier variable
      `vm-mime-use-w3-for-text/html'.)

   ** vm-delete-duplicate-messages now works by comparing message ID's.
      (from Noah Friedman's vm-addons).

    * vm-yank-message function streamlined somewhat.  New variable
      `vm-include-text-from-presentation' used to extract message text
      from presentation buffer.  (This replaces the variable
      `vm-reply-include-presentation' used in vm-rfaddons.)

    * The variable `vm-mime-yank-attachments' is set to nil by default,
      so that we are not surprised by unexpectedly large mail messages.

    * The variable `vm-mime-require-mime-version-header' is set to nil
      by default, so that we will be tolerant of bad MIME senders.

    * Allow for sorting the headers of composition buffers by calling the
      function `vm-reorder-message-headers' interactively.  You may configure
      the order by the new variable `vm-mail-header-order'.  This can be
      useful if some broken MUAs (e.g. Tobit) mess up the messages due to the
      header order.

    * Added hiding and protection of headers in composition buffers.  See the
      new variable `vm-mail-mode-hidden-headers' for customization. (Thanks to
      Eric Schulte for the initial code posted in gnu.emacs.vm.info)

    * Added the function `vm-mime-list-part-structure' to list the mime part
      structure of a message.

    * Added function `vm-mime-nuke-alternative-text/html' which can be used to
      get rid of alternative text/html parts.

    * VMPC: Better action reader and a default profile which is used if no
      email addresses could be found.  The meaning of the arguments for
      `vmpc-prompt-for-profile' has been slightly simplified, see the doc
      string for details.  

    * Removed `vm-paragraph-fill-column', the value is now taken from
      `vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' thus allowing to fill to the
      available window with.

    * Replaced `vm-fill-paragraphs-containing-long-lines' by the faster and
      more flexible version from vm-rfaddons.el.  Also cleaned up calls to the
      fill function and removed code duplication.  The code using longline.el
      remains in vm-rfaddons.el, but it must be used explicitly now in an
      advice.

    * Moved the variable `vm-fill-long-lines-in-reply-column' from
      vm-rfaddons.el to VM core.  It is not necessary to hook the fill
      function, just set the variable.

    * Errors caused by `vm-retrieved-spooled-mail-hook' are reported and
      assimilation of messages continues instead of aborting.

    * Handle filenames also from the disposition fields "name", "filename*"
      and "name*", where the latter two get decoded as they might contain 8bit
      chars.

    * Uncoupled searching of MIME images from source location.  The search
      should be a bit smarter now allowing to place the images outside of the
      source tree now.

    * Added syncing of message status when visiting a mbox of Thunderbird.
      Not all message flags are interchangeable and the message summary
      file (.msf) of Thunderbird will get removed by VM in order to force
      Thunderbird to rebuilt it.  Also VMs folder index will be skipped if
      it is older than the folder in order to update VMs message status flags.

    * Improved text/html displaying by w3m.  Inline images are now extracted
      correctly and they also display now.  Added a generic handler code to
      support also other HTML handlers.

    * Added variable `vm-restore-saved-summary-formats' to restore
      each folder's summary format to what was saved previously.
      (Uday S. Reddy)

    * A prefix argument to `vm-fix-my-summary!!!' will kill a folders local
      summary format which was restored by `vm-restore-saved-summary-formats'.

    * The button for an image or PDF shows a thumbnail now when possible.
      This requires ImageMagick.  (Thanks to Eric Schulte for the idea and
      initial code.)

    * Allow to reorder messages headers before sending by setting the new
      variable `vm-mail-reorder-message-headers'.

    * Allow UTF-8 encoded messages to be displayed on tty.  (Ulrich Müller)

  BUG FIXES

    * `vm-quit-no-change' made to honour the setting of the variable
      `delete-auto-save-files'. (Uday S. Reddy)

    * Allow the use of iso-8859-1 for outgoing mail under Emacs 23
      (instead of spurious iso-2022-jp).  (Ulrich Müller)

    * Coding system set to binary when reading and writing to allow
      for 8-bit content.  (Julian Bradfield)

  IMPROVEMENTS for pop-folders (Uday S. Reddy)

    * Added the variable `vm-pop-debug' to keep trace buffers.

    * New commands `vm-pop-start-bug-report' and `vm-pop-submit-bug-report'
      which track POP session details.


  IMPROVEMENTS for imap-folders (Uday S. Reddy)

   ** New variable `vm-imap-account-alist' allows multiple IMAP
      accounts to be handled uniformly.  The variable
      `vm-imap-server-list' is now obsolete.  IMAP folders should be
      specified in the minibuffer using the account:mailbox format.
      See the info node on IMAP folders.

    * New variable `vm-load-headers-only' to enable headers-only
      downloading of IMAP folders.  (This is still experimental.)

    * IMAP-FCC is extended to work for virtual folders, but only if
      the real parent message is an IMAP message.

    * Made server expunge more robust.  Added new variable
      `vm-imap-expunge-retries' to force retries for sluggish servers.

    * Allow message attributes as well as labels to be saved on server.

    * Changed vm-imap-get-new-mail to do synchronization: reading and writing
      message attributes & labels, expunge messages in the cache.  Added
      variable `vm-imap-sync-on-get' to control this behavior.

    * Added command `vm-imap-synchronize' to do full synchronization. 

    * Trapping IMAP server errors uniformly.

    * Added variable `vm-imap-tolerant-of-bad-imap' to allow minor
      violations of the IMAP spec by IMAP servers.

    * New commands `vm-imap-start-bug-report' and `vm-imap-submit-bug-report'
      which track IMAP session details.

VM 8.0.14    2009-12-16

  BUGFIXES

    * Removed an incompatibility of the mapvector procedure with XEmacs.

VM 8.0.13    2009-11-29  

  MANAGEMENT CHANGES:

    * VM being maintained by "VM development team", vm@lists.launchpad.net,
      consisting of Robert Fenk, Uday Reddy and Ulrich Müller.

  BUGFIXES:

    * VM-Cache entries were broken by encoding the pretty printed cache string
      instead of the individual strings.  This bug was introduced in 8.0.10 by
      the bug fix for correctly storing the cached multibyte summary entries.
      It causes building of the summary to fail.  Broken cache entries are now
      detected and removed while loading a folder.

VM 8.0.12    2008-11-05

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Display version info when calling `vm-version' interactively.  (Thanks
      to Ulrich Müller)

    * Yanking of messages uses the same MIME decoding as the presentation
      now.  See the new variable `vm-mime-yank-attachments' to configure if
      attachments are also yanked.

    * `u-vm-color.el' is bundled and maintained with VM now.  Ulf Jasper handed
      it over to me as he switched to Gnus.

  BUGFIXES:

    * Detect w3 by using `locate-library' instead of checking for a bound
      `w3-about'. (Thanks to Klaus Straubinger)

    * vm.revno.el was not installed anymore b "make install".  (Thanks to
      Ulrich Müller for reporting)

    * Insert `emacs-version' instead of creating wrong version string for
      XEmacs, i.e. the patch level was the major version. (Thanks to Stephen
      Turnbull)

    * Correctly locate the data directory for the pixmaps when running as a
      XEmacs package.

    * Check for some MIME character sets that may be available in recent
      XEmacs.  (Thanks to Aidan Kehoe for the patch)

    * Some documentation fixes. (Thanks to Michael Ernst for the patches)

    * Fixed infinite loop in vm-mime-encode-words on XEmacs  21.5-b28.
      (Thanks to Aidan Kehoe for the patch)

    * Detect "score" (additionally to "hits") in "X-Spam-Status:" headers in
      `vm-su-spam-score-aux'. (Patch from Michael Ernst)

    * Typo fix in vm-pcrisis.texinfo. (Patch from Michael Ernst)

    * Header encoding was BASE64 instead of QP by default and it was not
      encoding whole words, but only the 8bit chars instead. (Thanks to Ulrich
      Müller for reporting)

    * MIME text parts interleaved by attachments are now correctly yanked,
      e.g. when replying to a message.

    * Limit the buffer-name length and sanitize the used characters. (Thanks
      to Mark Diekhans for reporting)

    * Do not fail on corrupted address headers.  (Reported by John Covici)

    * Fixed GTK detection and toolbar handling for newer Emacs 22 versions.

Public bug reported:
 
VM 8.0.11    2008-08-11

  BUGFIXES:

    * Removed dependency of vm-revno.el to other lisp sources to avoid
      building it in a release bundle.  (Thanks to Ralf Fassel)

VM 8.0.10    2008-07-22

  NOTES:

    * This is the first version of VM 8.* to be also released as a XEmacs
      package.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added missing documentation for `vm-user-agent', "?" binding and
      'vm-delete-duplicate-messages'.  (Thanks to Alan Wehmann)

    * `vm-message-history.el' now uses a buffer similar to the summary for
      browsing the history.  The buffer replaces the summary buffer when
      present.  Duplicate history entries will be removed.

    * Define and use `vm-replace-in-string' which is `replace-in-string'
      from XEmacs to avoid clashes with other GNU Emacs packages defining
      it differently. Unfortunately, GNU Emacs still does not provide this
      handy function. (Thanks to José Miguel Figueroa)

    * MIME encoding of header will automatically happen now and has been moved
      from `vm-rfaddons.el' to `vm-mime.el' and `vm-vars.el'.

  BUGFIXES:

    * Rewrote `vm-message-history.el' to also work for XEmacs.

    * Leading lines of a yanked message were accidently taken as headers and
      got removed if `vm-reply-include-presentation' was t.

    * Fixed encoding of headers for trailing 8 bit characters.  (Thanks to
      Lutz Euler for the patch)

    * Decode (QP-)encoded clear text before decrypting it.

    * Use nil as default for `vm-mime-8bit-composition-charset' and thus
      enable proper detection of right charset.  (Thanks to Naoki Saito for
      reporting and debugging)

    * Fixed bug in `vm-mime-display-external-generic' for GNU Emacs 23 causing
      corrupted content in the output file.  The old code has been replaced by
      a call to `vm-mime-send-body-to-file' which avoids duplication and works.
      There has been some special handling for `vm-fsfemacs-mule-p', but the
      actual reason for this was unclear so it has been removed.

    * Correctly handle `vm-enable-addons' being t.

    * Correctly store UTF-8 strings in the X-VM-v5-Data header to avoid
      corruption of summary lines. (Thanks to Yuning Feng for reporting)

    * Correctly encode multibyte subjects. (Thanks to Yuning Feng for the
      patch) 

    * Use BASE64 for header encoding when there are special chars not quoted
      by QP normally.  You may configure this by `vm-mime-encode-headers-type'.

    * qp-decode program handles premature end of QP-encoded stream now
      gracefully. (Thanks to Ralf Fassel for the bug report, fix and testing)

    * Added missing newline after "Content-Type" when using the command
      `vm-mime-attach-object-from-message'.  (Thanks to Dan Freed)

VM 8.0.9    2008-02-20

  BUGFIXES:

    * Added documentation to `vm-mime-external-content-types-alist' that no
      extra single quotes should be used around %f as the file name is already
      quoted for the shell. (Thanks to Martin Schwenke)

    * Fixed version number generation in release script.  It was broken for
      8.0.8, i.e. it was showing 8.0.x-xemacs-542 instead.  Now also other
      branch related information is stored in the file vm-revno.el.

VM 8.0.8    2008-02-11

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Reactivated "Allow defadvice on function `vm' by recursing on session
      start".  It should work correctly now.

    * Added interactive `vm-pipe-message-to-command-discard-output' and
      the non-interactive `vm-pipe-message-to-command-to-string' for using
      it in own functions.

    * Added `vm-pipe-messages-to-command*' for bulk piping messages to a
      single command, i.e. like saving to a pipe.  This is substantially
      faster than `vm-pipe-message-to-command*' which call the command on 
      each message separately.  You may want to use it to feed spamassasin.

    * Modified key bindings for piping messages, i.e. "|" is a prefix key
      now. Type it twice to get the old pipe command, "|d" will call the 
      discard the output, just display some infos in the mode line. "|s" 
      will call `vm-pipe-messages-to-command' and "|n" will also call it 
      but discard the output.

    * Removed vm-easymenu.el and use easymenu.el instead.

    * In `vm-save-message-preview', ask the user if the output file already
      exists instead of silently overwriting it.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Moved [Undo] to Dispose menu and [Emacs] to Help menu as these do not
      work in Emacs 22 anymore when on the menu bar.

    * Fixed intermixing of signature and quoted text in reply if
      `vm-reply-include-presentation' is t. (Thanks to Roland Winkler for
      debugging and reporting)

    * Fixed yanking of presentation from wrong folder when folder is virtual.
      (Thanks to Roland Winkler for reporting)

    * Redistributed flag not displayed in presentation buffer mode line. 
      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=428248 (Thanks to Jonathan
      Underwood for the fix)

    * `vm-submit-bug-report' gets the variables dynamically now and thus does
      not miss new ones or references old ones anymore. 

    * Correctly determine the real folder when postponing compositions started
      from a virtual folder. (Thanks to Uday S. Reddy for reporting and 
      debugging)

    * Avoid crash when `vm-mouse-set-mouse-track-highlight' is not called
      within a summary buffer or without a valid message pointer.

    * Do not disable modes which do not exist. (Thanks to Uday S. Reddy for
      reporting) 

    * Set correct coding-system-for-read for the real messages of
      virtual folders.  (Thanks to Julian Bradfield)

VM 8.0.7    2008-01-05

  BUG FIXES:

    * Disable only those minor modes listed in the variable
      `vm-disable-modes-before-encoding' before encoding a
      composition. (Thanks to Alley for reporting and debugging)

    * Removed recursion from function `vm' added by 8.0.6, as it 
      causes startup troubles.

    * Removed extra newline before attachment buttons. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting)

    * Removed wrongly used calls to `interactive-p'. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting and debugging)

VM 8.0.6    2008-01-02

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Rewrote INSTALL to be more consistent and more understandable.

    * Allow defadvice on function `vm' by recursing on session start. (Thanks
      to Blueman for the code)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Ignore empty reply-to in `vm-ignored-reply-to'.

    * Quoted the variable `vm-summary-format' in a doc string.

    * Fixed typos in the docstring of `vm-mail-send-and-exit'.

    * Disable all minor modes before encoding a composition.  This results in
      faster encoding when font-lock was enabled and avoids problems when
      parts of a MIME object button get expanded due to an abbrev and thus the
      extent/overlay gets split into two separate parts causing an encoding
      error.

    * Avoid duplicate mime buttons during decoding. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting)

    * Mask 8 bit chars by 0xff in `vm-mime-qp-encode-region' to avoid crash
      for those with all higher order bits set (negative ones?) (Thanks to
      Blueman for the fix.)

VM 8.0.5    2007-11-03

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed bug caused by fixing `vm-drop-buffer-name-chars' in 8.0.4.  There
      is a 20-40% chance to create a new bug when fixing one.  Regression
      tests would be nice, but we do not have any for VM ;-/

VM 8.0.4    2007-11-02

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Require cl.el at compile-time only. (Thanks to John J. Foerch)

    * Quiet compiler warning about old style backquotes. (Thanks to John
      J. Foerch)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Correctly call custom-add-load. (Thanks to John J. Foerch and
      Jonathan.underwood) 

    * Fixed building of vm-cus-load.el for Emacs 21.

    * Use the old default for `vm-primary-inbox', i.e. "~/INBOX".

    * Honor a t in `vm-drop-buffer-name-chars' as documented.

VM 8.0.3    2007-08-15

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Unified `vm-continue-what-message', i.e. first check for composition
      buffers, if none exist then for saved drafts.  Also added new variable
      `vm-zero-drafts-start-compose'.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed building of autoloads for GNU Emacs.

    * Docfixes for vm-pine.el (Thanks to Stephen Eglen).

    * Resurrected `vm-add-reply-subject-prefix' which was lost by the commit
      of revno 91.

    * Search for BZR only if bzrdir exists and use locate-file only when
      defined.

    * Use  vm-mime-8bit-composition-charset as a fallback also for MULE Emacs.

    * Fixed defcustom of vm-keep-crash-boxes and vm-spool-files.

    * Fixed the section headers of the NEWS file.

VM 8.0.2    2007-07-25

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added --with-pixmapdir to configure the location of the pixmaps.

    * DESTDIR-Patch (Ulrich Müller).

  BUG FIXES:

    * Avoid overflow of `buffer-undo-list' when inserting or encoding
      big attachments.

    * defcustom of `vm-mime-all-attachments-directory' should list nil.

    * Honor pre VM 8.0.0 values of `vm-folder-directory' and
      `vm-primary-inbox'. This should eliminate problems with users which
      never changed the defaults. 

    * Use "cygwin-mount" to fix paths when available.

    * Activate summary faces only when requested by vm-enable-addons.

    * Fixed defcustom of `vm-enable-addons' and added documentation.

    * "make install" creates $(bindir) now.

    * Separate paths (e.g. otherdirs) only by semicolons to avoid problems on
      Win32.

    * Handle paths with spaces correctly.

    * Install also pixmaps for GTK enabled Emacs.

    * Just use the first subject when replying/forwarding to a set of
      messages.  This avoids long filenames for saved composition buffers.
    
    * Ensure we are compiling with an emacs version >= 21.

    * Encode headers regexp and case-fold-search corrected. (Ulrich Müller)

    * vm-summary-faces-mode does not leak extents anymore.

VM 8.0.1    2007-06-29

  NOTES:

    In order to get more features from vm-rfaddons set the variable
    `vm-enable-addons' in your ~/.vm.

  BUG FIXES:

    * A saner default for vm-shrunken-header-face.

    * Added documentation on vm-shrunken-headers-face and
      vm-shrunken-headers-keymap.

    * Added a new custom group `vm-faces' for faces.

    * Added autoload token for vm-user-agent.

    * Use INSTALL_PROGRAM instead of INSTALL_DATA for programs.

    * Do not set vm-folder-directory if there is ~/INBOX.  If VM does not get
      mail after upgrading from 7.19 it is probably due to the new default for
      vm-folder-directory, which was nil before.

    * Revised the bindings and enabled features to a hopefully less
      controversial setting. 

VM 8.0.0    2007-05-31

    | Yes.  Obviously I've moved on, though I've been slow to admit it
    | to myself.  Good luck.
    `--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	   
    * My (robf) VM extensions are now activated by default, where it makes
      sense to me.

    * Releases are numbered now MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHLEVEL, where MAJOR is
      increased when fundamental changes occur, MINOR for new features and
      PATCHLEVEL for bugfix releases.

    * New cleaner source tree layout.

    * Better built system based on configure.  Autoloads are generated only
      for those functions marked with the autoload token now, which are mainly
      interactive function. Thus, loading occurs only on demand and startup
      should be faster.
      
  BUG FIXES:

    * All bugs reported to gnu.emacs.vm.bugs, gnu.emacs.vm.info and directly
      to me are fixed either by the patches posted by others or me.

    * If there are any missing autoloads, please report them and add a
      (require 'vm-SOURCE) to your ~/.vm!

    * Probably added numerous new bugs.


  IMPROVEMENTS: compared to 7.19 (not vmrf)

    * A new icon set based on vm-small-pixmaps.tgz which was floating around.
      This one should fit by height to the one used in XEmacs and Emacs 22,
      but it is slightly larger than those used in Emacs 21.  If you see the
      old icons, the please set the variables `vm-image-directory' and
      `vm-toolbar-pixmap-directory' to nil in your ~/.vm!

    * vm-mime-type-converter-alist now also works when replying to messages,
      i.e. for text/html one can use lynx or w3m for the conversion.
      (setq vm-mime-type-converter-alist
	'(("text/html" "text/plain" "lynx -force_html -dump /dev/stdin")))

    * Postponing (draft handling) of compositions and continuing of drafts, in
      fact any messages also those from other people. (Info node: Sending
      Messages) 

    * New mail header insertion functions for return-receipts, mail-priority
      and FCC.

    * More virtual folder selectors and replacements of other functions based
      on selectors. (Info node: Virtual Folders)

    * vm-serial.el provides message templates for composition and
      personalizes mass emails. (Info node: TODO)
    
    * vm-biff.el for popups with a list of new messages.

    * vm-rfaddons.el has various stuff, look at the source if you are curious
      or miss some VM feature, as it might already be there!
