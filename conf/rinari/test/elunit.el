;;; Commentary:

;; Inspired by regress.el by Wayne Mesard and Tom Breton, Test::Unit
;; by Nathaniel Talbott, and xUnit by Kent Beck

;; ElUnit exists to accomodate test-driven development of Emacs Lisp
;; programs.  Tests are divided up into suites.  Each test makes a
;; number of assertions to ensure that things are going according to
;; expected.

;; Tests are divided into suites for the purpose of hierarchical
;; structure and hooks.  The hierarchy allows suites to belong to
;; suites, in essence creating test trees.  The hooks are meant to
;; allow for extra setup that happens once per test, for both before
;; and after it runs.

;; The file `elunit-assertions.el' provides a number of helpful
;; assertions for ensuring that things are going properly.  You may use
;; Emacs' built-in `assert' function for checking such things, but the
;; assertions in that file provide much better reporting if you use
;; them.  Using `assert-that' is preferred over built-in `assert'.

;;; Todo:

;;  * more helper functions, specifically for more functional-test stuff.

;;; Usage:

;; See http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ElUnit for discussion and usage.
;; The file `elunit-test.el' contains meta-tests that you may find helpful
;; to refer to as samples.

;; Add the lines:
;; (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook)
;; (add-hook 'after-save-hook (lambda () (elunit "meta-suite")))
;; to the file containing your tests for convenient auto-running.
