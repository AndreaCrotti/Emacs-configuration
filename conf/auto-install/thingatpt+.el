;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `thingatpt.el'
;;              have been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `form-at-point'            - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `list-at-point'            - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `number-at-point'          - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `sentence-at-point'        - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `sexp-at-point'            - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `symbol-at-point'          - Added optional argument NON-NIL.
;;  `thing-at-point'           - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `word-at-point'            - Added optional argument SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;
;;
;;  A reminder (the doc strings are not so good):
;;
;;    These functions, defined in `thingatpt.el', all move point:
;;      `beginning-of-thing', `end-of-sexp', `end-of-thing',
;;      `forward-symbol', `forward-thing', `forward-whitespace'
;;
;;
;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `thingatpt.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load "thingatpt" '(require 'thingatpt+))

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2010/01/24 dadams
;;     Added: region-or-word-nearest-point.
;; 2008/10/22 dadams
;;     Added: region-or-word-at-point.  Thx to Richard Riley.
;; 2007/07/15 dadams
;;     Added: thing/form-nearest-point-with-bounds,
;;            non-nil-symbol(-name)-(at|nearest)-point, near-point-(x|y)-distance.
;;     (thing|form)-nearest-point-with-bounds:
;;       Use thing/form-nearest-point-with-bounds, which: (1) accepts PRED arg,
;;         (2) respects near-point-(x|y)-distance, (3) fixed some logic.
;;     form-at-point-with-bounds:
;;       Distinguish between nil (no find) and "nil" object found.
;;     (bounds-of-)symbol-(at|nearest)-point(-with-bounds), :
;;       Added optional non-nil arg.
;;     Added beginning-op, end-op, and forward-op for defun type.
;; 2006/12/08 dadams
;;     Added: find-fn-or-var-nearest-point.
;; 2006/05/16 dadams
;;     Only require cl (at compile time) for Emacs < 20.
;;     Replace incf by setq...1+.
;; 2005/12/17 dadams
;;     symbol-name-nearest-point, form-at-point-with-bounds:
