;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Look up synonyms for a word or phrase in a thesaurus.
;;
;;
;;  Getting Started
;;  ---------------
;;
;;  To use library Synonyms, you will need the Moby Thesaurus II file,
;;  `mthesaur.txt', available here:
;;
;;    ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02/mthes10.zip
;;
;;  Put this in your initialization file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;    ;; The file names are absolute, not relative, locations
;;    ;;     - e.g. /foobar/mthesaur.txt.cache, not mthesaur.txt.cache
;;    (setq synonyms-file <name & location of mthesaur.txt>)
;;    (setq synonyms-cache-file <name & location of your cache file>)
;;    (require 'synonyms)
;;
;;  As an alternative to the first two lines, you can use Customize to
;;  set `synonyms-file' and `synonyms-cache-file' persistently.  The
;;  second of these files is created by this library, to serve as a
;;  synonym cache for completion.
;;
;;  The main command is `synonyms'.  It prompts you for a word or
;;  phrase to look up in the thesaurus.  The synonyms found are then
;;  displayed in buffer *Synonyms*.  For example, `M-x synonyms RET
;;  democracy' displays synonyms for `democracy'.
;;
;;  If you do not define `synonyms-file' and `synonyms-cache-file'
;;  prior to using command `synonyms', it will prompt you to define
;;  them.  If you want to use the same values during subsequent Emacs
;;  sessions, then you should use `customize-option' to save those
;;  newly defined values.
;;
;;
;;  Some Definitions
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  The thesaurus is divided into "entries", which are like glossary
;;  entries: each entry is followed by associated words and phrases,
;;  which, for lack of a better word, I refer to as "synonyms".  For
;;  example, `democracy' is an entry, and it is followed by its
;;  synonyms.  Some synonyms are not also entries.  For example,
;;  `patriarchy' is in the thesaurus as a synonym but not as an entry.
;;
;;  Note: What I call "synonyms" here are not necessarily synonyms, in
;;  the sense of having the same or even similar meanings.  They are
;;  simply terms collected together with the same thesaurus entry
;;  because they are related in some way - the grouping is what
;;  defines their relation.
;;
;;  In Moby Thesaurus II, the meanings of synonyms in the same group
;;  do have something in common, but this might be simply the fact
;;  that they are terms of a similar kind.  For example, the
;;  "synonyms" following the `democracy' thesaurus entry are words
;;  such as `dictatorship' and `autocracy'.  These are different forms
;;  of the same general thing: government - they are certainly not
;;  synonymous with each other or with the entry `democracy'.
;;
;;
;;  Searching the Thesaurus
;;  -----------------------
;;
;;  The default input value for command `synonyms' is the word under
;;  the cursor. Alternatively, if a region is active and you are in
;;  Transient Mark mode (recommended), then it is the text in the
;;  region (selection).
;;
;;  Your input is actually treated as a regular expression (regexp),
;;  so you can also input patterns like `for.*ion', which will match
;;  thesaurus entries `formation', `formulation', `fornication',
;;  `fortification', and `forward motion'.  Note that the last of
;;  these is a phrase rather than a single word.
;;
;;  Using a regexp as input is a powerful way to search, but be aware
;;  that it can be costly in CPU time and computer memory if the
;;  regexp is not appropriate.  The regexp `.*' will, for example,
;;  likely use up available memory before being able to return the
;;  entire thesaurus (it's very large).  You can always use `C-g' to
;;  interrupt a thesaurus search if you mistakenly use an inefficient
;;  regexp.
;;
;;
;;  Using a Prefix Argument To Do More
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  You can use a prefix argument to modify searching and the
;;  presentation of search results, as follows:
;;
;;    `C-u'     - Search for additional synonyms, in two senses:
;;
;;                1) Return also synonyms that are matched partially
;;                   by the input.
;;
;;                2) Search the entire thesaurus for input matches,
;;                   even if the input matches a thesaurus entry.
;;
;;    `M--'     - Append the search results to the any previous
;;                results, in buffer *Synonyms*.  (Normally, the new
;;                results replace any previous results.)
;;
;;    `C-u C-u' - `C-u' plus `M--': Search more and append results.
;;
;;  If you find yourself often using a particular prefix argument (for
;;  example, to append results), then you might want to instead change
;;  the default behavior to reflect this preference.  Options
;;  `synonyms-match-more-flag' and `synonyms-append-result-flag'
;;  correspond to using `C-u' and `M--', respectively.  In fact, a
;;  prefix argument simply toggles the value of the corresponding
;;  option for the duration of the command.  So, for example, if
;;  `synonyms-append-result-flag' is t and you use `M--', then results
;;  will not be appended.
;;
;;  When partially matching input (`C-u', sense #1), complete synonyms
;;  are matched against your input.  This means that you generally
;;  need not add a preceding or trailing `.*' to try to match a
;;  complete synonym.  For example, input `format' will match the
;;  complete synonyms `conformation', `efformation', `format',
;;  `formation', `formative', `formational', `information',
;;  `informative', `informational', `malformation', `deformation',
;;  `reformation', `transformation', `reformatory', and so on - there
;;  is no need to input `.*format.*' to match the same synonyms.
;;
;;  To better understand the meaning of #2 above for `C-u' (to
;;  continue the search even if your input matches an entry), try, for
;;  example, `C-u M-x synonyms RET widespread'.  You'll see not only
;;  the main synonyms listed for `widespread' as an entry, but also
;;  lots of different meanings of `widespread', judging by the entries
;;  for which it is listed as a synonym:
;;
;;    `accepted', `ample', `broad', `broadcast', `capacious',
;;    `catholic', `commodious', `commonness', `conventional',
;;    `currency', `current', `customary', `deep', `deltoid',
;;    `diffuse', `discrete', `dispersed', `disseminated',
;;    `dissipated', `distributed', `epidemic', `established',
;;    `everyday', `expansive', `extended', `extensive', `familiar',
;;    `fan shaped', `far flung', `far reaching', `flaring', `full',
;;    `general', `indiscriminate', `infinite', `large scale',
;;    `liberal', `normal', `normality', `open', `ordinary',
;;    `outstretched', `pervasive', `popular', `prescribed',
;;    `prescriptive', `prevailing', `prevalence', `prevalent',
;;    `public', `rampant', `received', `regnant', `regular',
;;    `regulation', `reign', `rife', `roomy', `ruling', `run',
;;    `scattered', `set', spacious`', `sparse', `splay', `sporadic',
;;    `sprawling', `spread', `standard', `stock', `straggling',
;;    `stretched out', `sweeping', `time-honored', `traditional',
;;    `universal', `usual', `vast', `voluminous', `wholesale', `wide
;;    open', `wide', and `wonted'.
;;
;;  These are just the entries! Each of these is of course followed by
;;  its own synonyms - perhaps 100 or 300, including `widespread'.
;;
;;  This list of entries is not the same list as the synonyms for
;;  entry `widespread'.  There are words and phrases here that are not
;;  in the latter list, and vice versa.  For example, the former (but
;;  not the latter) list includes `full'; the latter (but not the
;;  former) list includes `wide-reaching'.
;;
;;  The latter are the words most closely related to `widespread'.
;;  The list above are the other thesaurus entries (corresponding to
;;  main categories) to which `widespread' is most closely related.
;;  Looking at all of the synonym groups in which `widespread' appears
;;  can tell you additional information about its meanings - and it
;;  can provide additional synonyms for `widespread'.
;;
;;
;;  Using Completion with Synonyms
;;  ------------------------------
;;
;;  You can complete words and phrases in the minibuffer, as input to
;;  command `synonyms', and you can use Synonyms together with Icicles
;;  to complete a partial word in a text buffer into a word or phrase
;;  in the thesaurus.  For more information on Icicles, see library
;;  `icicles.el'.
;;
;;  ** Minibuffer Input Completion **
;;
;;  You can enter any text to match against thesaurus synonyms.  When
;;  you are prompted by command `synonyms' to enter this text, you can
;;  also use input completion to complete to a thesaurus synonym.
;;  That is, even though you can enter any text (including a regexp),
;;  completion will only complete to synonyms in the thesaurus.
;;
;;  Two different versions of the main command, `synonyms', are
;;  provided here.  If library `icicles.el' has already been loaded
;;  when you load `synonyms.el' (recommended), then the second, more
;;  powerful version is used; if not, the first version is used.  The
;;  second takes advantage of all Icicles features.  In particular, it
;;  lets you:
;;
;;   - Use `S-TAB' during completion to see the list of all synonyms
;;     (thesaurus terms) that match your minibuffer input so far.
;;
;;   - Use `[next]', and `[prior]' (usually keys Page Down and Page
;;     Up) during completion to cycle through the completion
;;     candidates (synonyms) that match your input.
;;
;;   - Use `C-o', `C-[next]', and `[C-prior]' during completion to
;;     display the synonyms of the current completion candidate.
;;
;;  ** Completing Text Using the Thesaurus **
;;
;;  Icicles provides two commands for using completion to insert
;;  thesaurus entries in a buffer:
;;
;;   - `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' completes a word in a text
;;     buffer to any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  I bind it to
;;     `C-c /'.
;;
;;   - `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry' inserts thesaurus words and
;;     phrases in a text buffer.  It is a multi-command, which means
;;     that, within a single call to it, you can insert any number of
;;     thesaurus entries, in succession.  If you want to, you can
;;     write an entire book using a single call to
;;     `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!
;;
;;
;;  Browsing the Thesaurus
;;  ----------------------
;;
;;  Besides using command `synonyms' to search for synonyms, you can
;;  use Synonyms to browse the thesaurus.  This is really just the
;;  same thing, but key and mouse bindings are provided in buffer
;;  *Synonyms*, so you need not input anything - just point and click
;;  the hyperlinks.  Buffer *Synonyms* is in Synonyms major mode,
;;  which provides a few additional features.
;;
;;  You can still choose to search for additional synonyms or append
;;  search results, without bothering with a prefix argument, by using
;;  modifier keys (Control, Meta) with a mouse click.
;;
;;  Another way of browsing is to revisit previous search-result
;;  pages.  You can do this using commands `synonyms-history-backward'
;;  and `synonyms-history-forward'.  In buffer *Synonyms*, these are
;;  bound to the following key sequences, for convenience:
;;
;;    `l', `p', `mouse-4' - `synonyms-history-backward'
;;    `r', `n', `mouse-5' - `synonyms-history-forward'
;;
;;  The `l' and `r' bindings correspond to the history bindings in
;;  Info.  The `p' and `n' bindings stand for "previous" and "next".
;;  The bindings to additional mouse buttons correspond to typical
;;  bindings for Back and Forward in Web browsers.
;;
;;  In addition to these bindings, the same history commands can be
;;  accessed by clicking links [Back] and [Forward] with `mouse-2'.
;;
;;  If you have previously used the append option (via, for example,
;;  `M-mouse2'), so that there are multiple search results in buffer
;;  *Synonyms*, then using a history command simply takes you to the
;;  preceding (for [Back]) or following (for [Forward]) result in the
;;  buffer, measured from the current cursor position.  Depending on
;;  the cursor position, this might be different from the previous or
;;  next search made previously.
;;
;;  This is for convenience, but it is also more efficient in the case
;;  of a regexp search that takes a long time.  Except for this
;;  special treatment of appended results, whenever you navigate the
;;  search-results history you are actually searching again for a
;;  synonym you sought previously.  The case of appended results is
;;  analogous to accessing a Web browser cache when navigating the
;;  history.
;;
;;  You can of course use modifier keys (Control, Meta) while you
;;  click links [Back] and [Forward], to impose their usual behavior:
;;  search for additional synonyms or append search results, or both.
;;
;;  Finally, some people prefer menus, so there is a Synonyms menu-bar
;;  menu when you are in Synonyms mode, complete with all of the
;;  functionalities described above.
;;
;;  For more information on the browsing possibilities in buffer
;;  *Synonyms*, use `?' in Synonyms mode.
;;
;;
;;  Dictionary Definitions, Antonyms, etc.
;;  --------------------------------------
;;
;;  Synonyms works with a large but simple database of groups of words
;;  and phrases that are synonyms of each other.  This database does
;;  not provide definitions of words or phrases; it simply groups
;;  them.  Command `synonym-definition' (aka `dictionary-definition')
;;  lets you look up a word or phrase (or a regexp) using one or more
;;  dictionaries on the Web.  That is usually the best source for this
;;  kind of information, but you obviously need an Internet connection
;;  to use this command.
;;
;;  Options (variables) `synonyms-dictionary-url' and
;;  `synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' are URLs you can set to point
;;  to the dictionaries of your choice.  The default value of
;;  `synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' looks up the search term in
;;  multiple dictionaries, and it lets you use wildcards.  Use `C-h v
;;  synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' for more information.  The
;;  default value of `synonyms-dictionary-url' usually provides a
;;  quicker answer.  Both of these URLs also give you access to
;;  additional information about the search term (antonyms, etymology,
;;  even pronunciation).
;;
;;  In buffer *Synonyms*, you can simply hit `d' followed by `RET' or
;;  `mouse-2' to look up a term that is in the buffer.  Just as for
;;  looking up a synonym by clicking `mouse-2', if you select text
;;  (region), then that text is looked up.
;;
;;
;;  A Cache File of Synonyms
;;  ------------------------
;;
;;  The very first time you use Synonyms, a large list of synonyms
;;  will be compiled and written to a cache file.  This is slow - it
;;  takes 2-3 minutes - but it is only a one-time cost.  From then on,
;;  whenever you first use Synonyms during an Emacs session, the cache
;;  file will be read (quickly), to create the list of synonyms that
;;  are used for minibuffer completion.
;;
;;
;;  Using Other Thesauri, Dictionaries, and so on - CSV data
;;  --------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There is nothing in library Synonyms that ties it to the Moby
;;  Thesaurus II thesaurus.  All of its functionality will work with
;;  any file of comma-separated values.  Each line of such a file is
;;  interpreted as a synonym group, as understood here, and the first
;;  word or phrase on each line is interpreted as a thesaurus entry,
;;  as understood here.  This means only that search results are
;;  organized into sections with entry headers.
;;
;;  If, for example, you had a CSV file of personal contacts, where
;;  the first term in each line was a last name or a company name,
;;  then you could use library Synonyms to query it, producing the
;;  same kind of output as for the thesaurus.
;;
;;  One thing to keep in mind if you try to use library Synonyms with
;;  a different CSV file is that there are several different CSV-file
;;  syntaxes.  The one that Synonyms is built to use is a simple one,
;;  with no quote marks around entries and no embedded quote marks
;;  within entries.
;;
;;  Similarly, there is nothing here that limits the functionality to
;;  English.  If you had a thesaurus in another language, it should
;;  work as well.
;;
;;  Currently, Synonyms works with a single raw synonyms file
;;  (thesaurus) and a corresponding single cache file (for
;;  completion).  However, it would be easy to extend the
;;  functionality to use multiple thesauri or, in general, multiple
;;  CSV files.  Suggestions of requirements (e.g. ways to select a
;;  thesaurus for particular passages of text) are welcome.

;;
;;
;;  Acknowledgements
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  The basic functionality provided here was derived from library
;;  `mthesaur.el', by Tad Ashlock <taashlo@cyberdude.com>.  That
;;  library, in turn, was inspired by library `thesaurus.el', by Ray
;;  Nickson.  Thanks also to those who sent helpful bug reports.
;;
;;
;;  Note on MS Windows Emacs 20 and Cygwin `grep'
;;  ---------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There is apparently a bug in the Emacs (at least versions 20-22) C
;;  code that implements function `call-process' on MS Windows.  When
;;  using native Windows Emacs with Cygwin commands, such as `grep',
;;  the C code removes a level of backslashes in some cases, so string
;;  arguments supplied to `call-process' need to have twice as many
;;  backslashes as they should need in those cases.  It is for this
;;  reason that option `synonyms-use-cygwin-flag' is supplied here.
;;  When that option is non-nil, backslashes in regexps are hacked to
;;  do the right thing.  (In Emacs 20, this means doubling the
;;  backslashes; in Emacs 21-22, this means doubling them unless there
;;  are spaces in the search string.)
;;
;;
;;  Maybe To Do?
;;  ------------
;;
;;  1. It would be ideal to have not only synonym information but also
;;     definitions, antonyms, more general and more specific terms,
;;     filtering by part of speech (verb vs adjective etc.), and so
;;     on.  A good example of what I'd really like to have is provided
;;     by the free Windows program WordWeb (available here:
;;     http://wordweb.info/).  Combining that functionality with
;;     Icicles completion features would provide a great tool, IMO.
;;
;;     `synonyms-definition*' goes a long way toward providing this,
;;     and perhaps it is the best way to go, since there is so much
;;     more definitional info on the Web.

;;     Added menu-bar Synonyms menu.
;;     Renamed synonyms-read-synonyms-from-cache to synonyms-ensure-synonyms-read-from-cache.
;;       Call it from synonyms, not from synonyms-mode.
;;     Defined synonyms-mode-map per convention.
;;     synonyms-match-more, synonyms-append-result, synonyms-match-more+append-result:
;;       Use synonyms, not synonyms-no-read.
;;     Added: synonyms-*-no-read.  Bound those, not the new read versions.

;;; Functions ----------------------------------------------

(define-derived-mode synonyms-mode text-mode "Synonyms"
  "Major mode for browsing thesaurus entries (synonyms).
Like Text mode but with these additional key bindings:

 \\<synonyms-mode-map>\\[synonyms-mouse],     \\[synonyms-no-read],     \\[synonyms] - \
Look up synonyms for a word or phrase
 \\[synonyms-mouse-match-more],   \\[synonyms-match-more]   - Like \\[synonyms-no-read], but \
try to match more terms
 \\[synonyms-mouse-append-result],   \\[synonyms-append-result]   - Like \\[synonyms-no-read], but \
add result to previous result
 \\[synonyms-mouse-match-more+append-result], \\[synonyms-match-more+append-result] - Like \
\\[synonyms-match-more] and \\[synonyms-append-result] combined

 \\[scroll-up] - Scroll down through the buffer of synonyms
 \\[scroll-down] - Scroll up through the buffer of synonyms
 \\[describe-mode]   - Display this help
 \\[quit-window]   - Quit Synonyms mode

Of the various key bindings that look up synonyms, the most flexible
is \\[synonyms] - it prompts you for the search string to match.  This
can be a regular expression (regexp).  The other lookup bindings are
for convenience - just click.

In Synonyms mode, Transient Mark mode is enabled.

Options `synonyms-match-more-flag' and `synonyms-append-result-flag'
affect synonym matching and the results.  For convenience, \\[synonyms-mouse-match-more],
\\[synonyms-mouse-append-result], and \\[synonyms-mouse-match-more+append-result] \
toggle the effect of those options for the
duration of the command.

Note that even though Synonyms mode is similar to Text mode, buffer
`*Synonyms*' is read-only, by default - use `C-x C-q' to toggle.

Turning on Synonyms mode runs the normal hooks `text-mode-hook' and
`synonyms-mode-hook' (in that order)."

Selection is useful when you want to see synonyms of a similar term.
For example, instead of clicking the listed synonym `bleeding heart', you
might select `heart' and click that.
