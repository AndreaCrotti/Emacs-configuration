;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Automatically resize one-window frames to fit.
;;
;;  Functions are provided here to automatically resize each frame to
;;  fit its selected window, when there is no other window in the
;;  frame.  Standard Emacs primitive functions are redefined to do
;;  this: `display-buffer', `switch-to-buffer', and `pop-to-buffer'.
;;
;;  Automatic frame resizing is also provided here implicitly for
;;  functions `switch-to-buffer-other-window' and
;;  `switch-to-buffer-other-frame', since they ultimately use
;;  `display-buffer'. (Command `switch-to-buffer' does not use
;;  `display-buffer', so it is redefined separately here.)
;;
;;  Put the following in your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs'),
;;  in order to provide for automatic frame resizing:
;;
;;    (require 'autofit-frame)
;;    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)
;;
;;  The second line here causes newly created frames to be fitted to
;;  their buffer (window).  Even if you load `auto-fit-frames.el', you
;;  will still need to do this, because `display-buffer' and so on are
;;  not called when a new frame is created.
;;
;;  To automatically fit frames that show a temporary buffer in their
;;  sole window, add this to your initialization file also:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-show-hook
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;  User option (variable) `autofit-frames-flag' turns on and off the
;;  automatic resizing defined here.  Setting it to nil turns it off:
;;  (setq autofit-frames-flag nil).  You can also bind it to nil to
;;  temporarily inhibit frame resizing in Lisp code:
;;
;;         (let ((autofit-frames-flag nil))...)
;;
;;
;;  New user option (variable) defined here: `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;  New function defined here (useful as a `temp-buffer-show-hook'):
;;
;;    `fit-frame-if-one-window'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `simple.el' have been
;;              REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `window--display-buffer-1' -
;;     Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following EMACS PRIMITIVES are REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (and provided buffer was not yet displayed).
;;     3) Raise the frame.
;;     4) Restore point in buffer - fixes unknown Emacs 22 bug.
;;
;;  `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     Use the `display-buffer' defined here.
;;
;;  `switch-to-buffer' -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) If current window is dedicated, then use another window.
;;     3) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (unless BUFFER is already the `current-buffer').
;;
;;
;;  This file loads file `fit-frame.el', which provides the main
;;  functionality behind the automatic frame resizing.  See it for
;;  user options to do such things as customize default frame sizes.
;;
;;  The reason for separating the code here from that in
;;  `fit-frame.el' is to let you load that code but not load the code
;;  here, if you do not want to redefine Emacs primitives.
;;
;;  This file was formerly called `shrink-fit-all.el', then
;;  `auto-resize-frames.el'.
;;
;;
;;  See also these files for other frame commands:
;;
;;     `doremi-frm.el'    - Incrementally adjust frame properties
;;                          using arrow keys and/or mouse wheel.
;;
;;     `frame-cmds.el'    - Miscellaneous frame and window commands.
;;
;;     `thumb-frm.el'     - Shrink frames to a thumbnail size and
;;                          restore them again.
;;
;;     `zoom-frm.el'      - Zoom a frame, so that its font becomes
;;                          larger or smaller.

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2009/05/03 dadams
;;     Use (fboundp 'window--display-buffer-1), not Emacs version test.
;; 2009/03/08 dadams
;;     Do not redefine for Emacs 23+: pop-to-buffer, display-buffer.
;;     Added (Emacs 23+): window--display-buffer-1.
;;     display-buffer: Added save-excursion around save-selected-window.
;; 2007/09/03 dadams
;;     Added: redefinition of pop-to-buffer.
;;     display-buffer: Raise frame.  Needed for buffer in thumbnail frame.
;;                     Don't fit frame if buffer was already displayed.
;; 2007/02/14 dadams
;;     display-buffer: Hack: restore point, to work around some Emacs 22 bug.
;; 2006/03/07 dadams
;;     switch-to-buffer: Bug fix: return destination buffer.  Thx to AndreyZ.
;; 2006/01/07 dadams
;;     Added :link for sending bug report.
;; 2006/01/06 dadams
;;     Removed defgroup - we require fit-frame.el, which does it.
;; 2005/09/02 dadams
;;     switch-to-buffer: Don't require existing buffer.
;; 2005/05/28 dadams
;;     autofit-frames-flag: defvar -> defcustom.  Added defgroup fit-frame.
;;     switch-to-buffer: Use explicit default in read-buffer.
;;       Require misc-fns.el.
;; 2004/10/07 dadams
;;     Renamed resize-* to fit-*, per RMS.
;;     Renamed automatically-resize-frames-p to autofit-frames-flag.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Commented-out redefinition of pop-to-buffer.  Removed it from intro.
;; 2004/06/01 dadams
;;     1. Replaced fit-frame-when-display-p, fit-frame-when-pop-to-p,
;;        and fit-frame-when-switch-to-p by
;;        automatically-resize-frames-p.
;;     2. Removed pop-to-buffer and
;;        resize-frame-if-one-window-and-cond.
;;     3. Renamed fit-frame-* to resize-frame-*.  Renamed file.
;;     4. switch-to-buffer: Don't resize if buffer is already current.
;; 2004/05/07 dadams
;;     Updated to work with Emacs 21:
;;       pop-to-buffer has additional arg and doc-string changes
;;       display-buffer has doc-string changes

BUFFER can be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.
If BUFFER is shown already in some window, just use that one,
unless the window is the selected window and the optional second
argument NOT-THIS-WINDOW is non-nil (interactively, with prefix arg).
If `pop-up-frames' is non-nil, make a new frame if no window shows BUFFER.

  If `display-buffer-reuse-frames' is non-nil, and another frame is
  currently displaying BUFFER, then simply raise that frame.

The variables `special-display-buffer-names', `special-display-regexps',
`same-window-buffer-names', and `same-window-regexps' customize how certain
buffer names are handled.

If optional argument FRAME is `visible', search all visible frames.
If FRAME is 0, search all visible and iconified frames.
If FRAME is t, search all frames.
If FRAME is a frame, search only that frame.
If FRAME is nil, search only the selected frame
 (actually the last nonminibuffer frame),
 unless `pop-up-frames' or `display-buffer-reuse-frames' is non-nil,
 which means search visible and iconified frames.

Emacs 21 or later only:

  out if displaying the buffer causes two vertically adjacent windows
  to be displayed.

frame is assumed to already be the size you want (perhaps you resized
it manually)."
