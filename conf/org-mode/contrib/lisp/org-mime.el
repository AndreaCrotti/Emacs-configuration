;; WYSWYG, html mime composition using org-mode
;;
;; For mail composed using the orgstruct-mode minor mode, this
;; provides a function for converting all or part of your mail buffer
;; to embedded html as exported by org-mode.  Call `org-mime-htmlize'
;; in a message buffer to convert either the active region or the
;; entire buffer to html.
;;
;; Similarly the `org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize' function can be called
;; from within an org-mode buffer to convert the buffer to html, and
;; package the results into an email handling with appropriate MIME
;; encoding.
;;
;; you might want to bind this to a key with something like the
;; following message-mode binding
;; 
;;   (add-hook 'message-mode-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (local-set-key "\C-c\M-o" 'org-mime-htmlize)))
;;
;; and the following org-mode binding
;; 
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (local-set-key "\C-c\M-o" 'org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize)))
