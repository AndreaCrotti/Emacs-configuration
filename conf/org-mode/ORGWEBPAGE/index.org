- Simplicity :: At its core, Org-mode is a simple outliner for
     note-taking and list management. You can learn the basics for
     using it in [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.php][five minutes]].  This may be all you need, and Org-mode
     will not impose more complex features on you.
- Portability :: Org files are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text][plain text]].  You can view and edit them
     in any editor, or add and extract data with custom-made scripts.
     Your data will never be locked into an obscure or proprietary
     data format.  Org-mode runs in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], which is available for
     nearly every platform.
- Depth :: Org-mode will not let you down when you need more than a
     simple outline.  The full feature set is both broad and deep,
     easy to access, but unobtrusive.  The [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][typical answer]] to "/Can it
     do X?/" is "/Yes!/".
- Flexibility :: Org-mode is like a Swiss army knife.  People use it
     for [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html][Getting Things Done (GTD)]], as a [[http://www.newartisans.com/blog_files/org.mode.day.planner.php][Day Planner]], as a [[http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/01/18/outlining-your-notes-with-org/][Notebook]],
     for Web and PDF [[http://orgmode.org][Authoring]], and much more.
- Support :: Org-mode is [[http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][documented extensively]], and many [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/index.php][tutorials]]
     put spotlights on particular features.  Org-mode is supported by
     an active [[id:0B280B26-A3AB-4E5C-B4EE-B7FFC52C4D26][mailing list]] where questions are answered quickly and
     effectively.
- It's free! :: Org is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software][open source software]], it is [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL][free]], like Emacs.

* Downloads

** The standard distribution

Download as [[file:org-7.01g.zip][zip file]] or [[file:org-7.01g.tar.gz][gzipped tar archive]].  These archives contain
both the Lisp file org.el and the documentation in PDF and (TeX)Info
formats.  Follow the instructions for [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html#Installation][Installation]] and [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Activation.html#Activation][Activation]].

** The development version

You can check out the latest Org development version (along with every
release we ever had) by using git.  The git repository is [[http://repo.or.cz/w/org-mode.git][browsable
online]].  To get a local clone use something like the following (from 
the command line....):

: git clone git://repo.or.cz/org-mode.git

Some more information about this can be found in the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][FAQ]], under [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development][How do
I keep current with Org mode development?]].  For people who cannot use
git, we provide [[file:org-latest.zip][zip]] or [[file:org-latest.tar.gz][tar.gz]] snapshot release files updated each hour
and corresponding to the latest git version.

** Alternative distributions

   There are several alternative distributions of Org.  Some of these
   are more up-to-date than others, so check if this package really
   has a recent version

   - The [[http://packages.debian.org/sid/main/org-mode][Debian package]] is maintained by Sebastien Delafond.
   - There is also a package on [[http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?do_Details&ID=18206][Archlinux]], by Jiyunatori.
   - The [[http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/%3Fgroup%3Demacs][Emacs CVS]] contains a more-or-less recent version.

* Documentation
** The Org guide and manual
   - Read the [[file:guide/index.html][online compact guide]] or download it as a [[file:orgguide.pdf][PDF document]].
     The compact guide is a 40-page introduction to Org mode.  It
     covers all features in a basic way and has links to in-depth
     documentation in the manual and on the web.
   - Read the [[file:manual/index.html][online manual]].  The manual covers the complete feature
     set with all the bells and whistles, in a systematic way.  The
     main structure is identical to the guide, so it is easy to go
     back and forth between basic and advanced documentation.
   - You can also have the entire manual in a [[file:org.html][single monolithic file]].
   - Download the manual as a 200-page [[file:org.pdf][PDF document]].
   - A [[http://hpcgi1.nifty.com/spen/index.cgi?OrgMode%2fManual][Japanese translation]] of the manual (version 4.60), by Takeshi
     Okano.

   - There is also a [[file:orgcard.txt][text version]] of the
     reference card.
** The FAQ
   - The [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][Org Mode FAQ]] is user-editable and is maintained by the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg
     project]].

** MobileOrg
   [[http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/][MobileOrg]] is an excellent open source application to read and
   change Org-files on the road, using an iPhone, and then sync the
   changes back to your computer.  Check out Richard's [[http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/][page]].

   Matt Jones is currently developing a compatible application for
   Android, and this project is [[http://wiki.github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/][hosted here]].
** Worg

[[http://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg]], created by [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/][Bastien Guerry]], is a setup to allow users to jointly
edit a number of Org-mode files containing documentation about
Org-mode, including the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][Org Mode FAQ]] and [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/index.php][Tutorials]].  Worg is similar
to a wiki in that allows community to edit the contents.  However,
since it uses a distributed version control system, you do not have to
be online while editing it.  If you'd like to contribute to Worg,
please go to [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][the Worg page]], and start from there.

** Contributing to Org-mode

You can always contribute with ideas and bug reports on the mailing
list.  If you want to contribute a patch, code snippets, or a full
add-on, this is very welcome too!  Detailed information on how and
what to contribute can be found [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.php][here]].
