;;; Commentary:

;; This program allow configurable publishing of related sets of
;; Org-mode files as a complete website.
;;
;; org-publish.el can do the following:
;;
;; + Publish all one's org-files to HTML or PDF
;; + Upload HTML, images, attachments and other files to a web server
;; + Exclude selected private pages from publishing
;; + Publish a clickable index of pages
;; + Manage local timestamps for publishing only changed files
;; + Accept plugin functions to extend range of publishable content
;;
;; Documentation for publishing is in the manual.

  :tag "Org Publishing"
  :group 'org)

(defcustom org-publish-project-alist nil
  "Association list to control publishing behavior.
Each element of the alist is a publishing 'project.'  The CAR of
each element is a string, uniquely identifying the project.  The
CDR of each element is in one of the following forms:

  (:property value :property value ... )

OR,

  (:components (\"project-1\" \"project-2\" ...))

When the CDR of an element of org-publish-project-alist is in
this second form, the elements of the list after :components are
taken to be components of the project, which group together files
requiring different publishing options.  When you publish such a
project with \\[org-publish], the components all publish.

When a property is given a value in org-publish-project-alist, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable
\(if any) during publishing.  However, options set within a file
override everything.

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set:

  :base-directory        Directory containing publishing source files
  :base-extension        Extension (without the dot!) of source files.
                         This can be a regular expression.
  :publishing-directory  Directory (possibly remote) where output
                         files will be published

The :exclude property may be used to prevent certain files from
being published.  Its value may be a string or regexp matching
file names you don't want to be published.

The :include property may be used to include extra files.  Its
value may be a list of filenames to include. The filenames are
considered relative to the base directory.

When both :include and :exclude properties are given values, the
exclusion step happens first.

One special property controls which back-end function to use for
publishing files in the project.  This can be used to extend the
set of file types publishable by org-publish, as well as the set
of output formats.

  :publishing-function     Function to publish file.  The default is
                           `org-publish-org-to-html', but other
                           values are possible.  May also be a
                           list of functions, in which case
                           each function in the list is invoked
                           in turn.

Another property allows you to insert code that prepares a
project for publishing.  For example, you could call GNU Make on a
certain makefile, to ensure published files are built up to date.

  :preparation-function   Function to be called before publishing
                          this project.
  :completion-function    Function to be called after publishing
                          this project.

Some properties control details of the Org publishing process,
and are equivalent to the corresponding user variables listed in
the right column.  See the documentation for those variables to
learn more about their use and default values.

  :email                 `user-mail-address'

The following properties may be used to control publishing of an
index of files or summary page for a given project.

  :auto-index            Whether to publish an index during
                         `org-publish-current-project' or `org-publish-all'.
  :index-filename        Filename for output of index.  Defaults
                         to 'sitemap.org' (which becomes 'sitemap.html').
  :index-title           Title of index page.  Defaults to name of file.
  :index-function        Plugin function to use for generation of index.
                         Defaults to `org-publish-org-index', which
                         generates a plain list of links to all files
                         in the project.
  :index-style           Can be `list' (index is just an itemized list
                         of the titles of the files involved) or
                         `tree' (the directory structure of the source
                         files is reflected in the index).  Defaults to
                         `tree'."
