;;; Commentary:

;; This program allow configurable publishing of related sets of
;; Org-mode files as a complete website.
;;
;; org-publish.el can do the following:
;;
;; + Publish all one's org-files to HTML or PDF
;; + Upload HTML, images, attachments and other files to a web server
;; + Exclude selected private pages from publishing
;; + Publish a clickable sitemap of pages
;; + Manage local timestamps for publishing only changed files
;; + Accept plugin functions to extend range of publishable content
;;
;; Documentation for publishing is in the manual.

;;; Code:

(defgroup org-publish nil
  "Options for publishing a set of Org-mode and related files."
  :tag "Org Publishing"
  :group 'org)

(defcustom org-publish-project-alist nil
  "Association list to control publishing behavior.
Each element of the alist is a publishing 'project.'  The CAR of
each element is a string, uniquely identifying the project.  The
CDR of each element is in one of the following forms:

  (:property value :property value ... )

OR,

  (:components (\"project-1\" \"project-2\" ...))

When the CDR of an element of org-publish-project-alist is in
this second form, the elements of the list after :components are
taken to be components of the project, which group together files
requiring different publishing options.  When you publish such a
project with \\[org-publish], the components all publish.

When a property is given a value in org-publish-project-alist, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable
\(if any) during publishing.  However, options set within a file
override everything.

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set:

  :base-directory        Directory containing publishing source files
  :base-extension        Extension (without the dot!) of source files.
                         This can be a regular expression.  If not given,
                         \"org\" will be used as default extension.
  :publishing-directory  Directory (possibly remote) where output
                         files will be published

The :exclude property may be used to prevent certain files from
being published.  Its value may be a string or regexp matching
file names you don't want to be published.

The :include property may be used to include extra files.  Its
value may be a list of filenames to include. The filenames are
considered relative to the base directory.

When both :include and :exclude properties are given values, the
exclusion step happens first.

One special property controls which back-end function to use for
publishing files in the project.  This can be used to extend the
set of file types publishable by org-publish, as well as the set
of output formats.

  :publishing-function     Function to publish file.  The default is
                           `org-publish-org-to-html', but other
                           values are possible.  May also be a
                           list of functions, in which case
                           each function in the list is invoked
                           in turn.

Another property allows you to insert code that prepares a
project for publishing.  For example, you could call GNU Make on a
certain makefile, to ensure published files are built up to date.

  :preparation-function   Function to be called before publishing
                          this project.  This may also be a list
                          of functions.
  :completion-function    Function to be called after publishing
                          this project.  This may also be a list
                          of functions.

Some properties control details of the Org publishing process,
and are equivalent to the corresponding user variables listed in
the right column.  See the documentation for those variables to
learn more about their use and default values.

  :author                `user-full-name'
  :email                 `user-mail-address'

The following properties may be used to control publishing of a
sitemap of files or summary page for a given project.

  :auto-sitemap           Whether to publish a sitemap during
                         `org-publish-current-project' or `org-publish-all'.
  :sitemap-filename      Filename for output of sitemap.  Defaults
                         to 'sitemap.org' (which becomes 'sitemap.html').
  :sitemap-title         Title of sitemap page.  Defaults to name of file.
  :sitemap-function      Plugin function to use for generation of sitemap.
                         Defaults to `org-publish-org-sitemap', which
                         generates a plain list of links to all files
                         in the project.
  :sitemap-style         Can be `list' (sitemap is just an itemized list
                         of the titles of the files involved) or
                         `tree' (the directory structure of the source
                         files is reflected in the sitemap).  Defaults to
                         `tree'.

  If you create a sitemap file, adjust the sorting like this:

  :sitemap-sort-folders    Where folders should appear in the sitemap.
                           Set this to `first' (default) or `last' to
                           display folders first or last, respectively.
                           Any other value will mix files and folders.
  :sitemap-alphabetically  The site map is normally sorted alphabetically.
                           Set this explicitly to nil to turn off sorting.
  :sitemap-ignore-case     Should sorting be case-sensitive?  Default nil.

The following properties control the creation of a concept index.

  :makeindex             Create a concept index."
