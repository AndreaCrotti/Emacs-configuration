;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module implements inline tasks in Org-mode.  Inline tasks are
;; tasks that have all the properties of normal outline nodes, including
;; the ability to store meta data like scheduling dates, TODO state, tags
;; and properties.  However, these nodes are treated specially by the
;; visibility cycling and export commands.
;;
;; Visibility cycling exempts these nodes from cycling. So whenever their
;; parent is opened, so are these tasks.  This will only work with
;; `org-cycle', so if you are also using other commands to show/hide
;; entries, you will occasionally find these tasks to behave like
;; all other outline nodes, seemingly splitting the text of the parent
;; into children.
;;
;; Export commands do not treat these nodes as part of the sectioning
;; structure, but as a special inline text that is either removed, or
;; formatted in some special way.
;;
;; Special fontification of inline tasks, so that they can be immediately
;; recognized.  From the stars of the headline, only the first and the
;; last two will be visible, the others will be hidden using the
;; `org-hide' face.
;;
;; An inline task is identified solely by a minimum outline level, given
;; by the variable `org-inlinetask-min-level', default 15.
;;
;; Inline tasks are normally assumed to contain at most a time planning
;; line (DEADLINE etc) after it, and then any number of drawers, for
;; example LOGBOOK of PROPERTIES.  No empty lines are allowed.
;; If you need to have normal text as part of an inline task, you
;; can do so by adding an "END" headline with the same number of stars,
;; for example
;;
;;    **************** TODO some small task
;;                     DEADLINE: <2009-03-30 Mon>
;;                     :PROPERTIES:
;;                       :SOMETHING: or other
;;                     :END:
;;                     And here is some extra text
;;    **************** END
;;
;; Also, if you want to use refiling and archiving for inline tasks,
;; The END line must be present to make things work properly.
;;
;; This package installs one new command:
;;
;; C-c C-x t      Insert a new inline task with END line
