;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating asymptote source code.
;;
;; This differs from most standard languages in that
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in asymptote
;;
;; 2) we are generally only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) we are adding the "file" and "cmdline" header arguments, if file
;;    is omitted then the -V option is passed to the asy command for
;;    interactive viewing

;;; Requirements:

;; - The asymptote program :: http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/
;;
;; - asy-mode :: Major mode for editing asymptote files

;;; Code:
