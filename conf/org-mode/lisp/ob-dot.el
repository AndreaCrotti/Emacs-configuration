;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating dot source code.
;;
;; For information on dot see http://www.graphviz.org/
;;
;; This differs from most standard languages in that
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in dot
;;
;; 2) we are generally only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) we are adding the "file" and "cmdline" header arguments
;;
;; 4) there are no variables (at least for now)

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-eval)

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:dot
  '((:results . "file") (:exports . "results"))
  "Default arguments to use when evaluating a dot source block.")

(defun org-babel-expand-body:dot (body params &optional processed-params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, return the expanded body."
  (let ((vars (nth 1 (or processed-params
			 (org-babel-process-params params)))))
    (mapc
     (lambda (pair)
       (let ((name (symbol-name (car pair)))
	     (value (cdr pair)))
	 (setq body
	       (replace-regexp-in-string
		(concat "\$" (regexp-quote name))
		(if (stringp value) value (format "%S" value))
		body))))
     vars)
    body))

(defun org-babel-execute:dot (body params)
  "Execute a block of Dot code with org-babel.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'."
  (let ((processed-params (org-babel-process-params params))
	(result-params (split-string (or (cdr (assoc :results params)) "")))
        (out-file (cdr (assoc :file params)))
        (cmdline (cdr (assoc :cmdline params)))
        (cmd (or (cdr (assoc :cmd params)) "dot"))
        (in-file (make-temp-file "org-babel-dot")))
    (with-temp-file in-file
      (insert (org-babel-expand-body:dot body params processed-params)))
    (org-babel-eval (concat cmd " " in-file " " cmdline " -o " out-file) "")
    out-file))

(defun org-babel-prep-session:dot (session params)
  "Return an error because Dot does not support sessions."
  (error "Dot does not support sessions"))
