;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating ditaa source code.
;;
;; This differs from most standard languages in that
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in ditaa
;;
;; 2) we are generally only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) we are adding the "file" and "cmdline" header arguments
;;
;; 4) there are no variables (at least for now)

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:ditaa
  '((:results . "file") (:exports . "results"))
  "Default arguments for evaluating a ditaa source block.")

(defun org-babel-expand-body:ditaa (body params &optional processed-params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, return the expanded body." body)

(defvar org-ditaa-jar-path)
(defun org-babel-execute:ditaa (body params)
  "Execute a block of Ditaa code with org-babel.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'."
  (let ((result-params (split-string (or (cdr (assoc :results params)) "")))
        (out-file (cdr (assoc :file params)))
        (cmdline (cdr (assoc :cmdline params)))
        (in-file (make-temp-file "org-babel-ditaa")))
    (unless (file-exists-p org-ditaa-jar-path)
      (error "Could not find ditaa.jar at %s" org-ditaa-jar-path))
    (with-temp-file in-file (insert body))
    (message (concat "java -jar " org-ditaa-jar-path " " cmdline " " in-file " " out-file))
    (shell-command (concat "java -jar " (shell-quote-argument org-ditaa-jar-path) " " cmdline " " in-file " " out-file))
    out-file))

(defun org-babel-prep-session:ditaa (session params)
  "Return an error because ditaa does not support sessions."
  (error "Ditaa does not support sessions"))
