This directory contains files that are necessary or at least useful
companions for Org-mode under XEmacs:

noutline.el

   Greg Chernov's port of the overlay-based implementation of
   outline-mode.  This is required, and until XEmacs uses this (or
   another port), you need to install it with Org-mode.  The "Installation"
   section in the Manual covers also the installation of  this package.

ps-print-invisible.el

   Greg Chernovs modification to ps-print, to honor invisible text
   properties during printing.  This file is not required for running
   Org-mode, but it is useful when trying to print partial trees.
