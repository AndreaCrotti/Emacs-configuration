;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides useful macros, functions, and classes
;; required by multiple JDE packages. You should not put any macros,
;; functions, or classes in this package that require other
;; JDE packages.
;;
;; This is one of a set of packages that make up the
;; Java Development Environment (JDE) for Emacs. See the
;; JDE User's Guide for more information.

;; The latest version of the JDE is available at
;; <URL:http://jdee.sourceforge.net>.

;; Please send any comments, bugs, or upgrade requests to
