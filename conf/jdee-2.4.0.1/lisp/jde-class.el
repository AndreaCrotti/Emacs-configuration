;; Commentary:

;; This is a package that contains various utility classes that are
;; useful when dealing with class files.  There are several macros to
;; enable one to write code that looks through all compiled class
;; files, such as `with-all-class-files', which calls some code for
;; every class files in the `jde-built-class-path'.  There is also
;; `with-all-class-infos-when', which tests each class file with some
;; predicate, and if it passes then makes the class-info available to
;; the code in the body.  `with-all-corresponding-class-infos' will
;; execte for classes that are compiled from a certain Java source file.
;;
;; There are also a few helper utilities here.
