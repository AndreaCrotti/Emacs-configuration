;;; Commentary:

;; This module provides support for writing and executing regression tests
;; for Emacs Lisp code.  When people bother to write regression tests at all,
;; they're typically included as off-hand comments:
;;
;;   ;; (add1 3)  ==> 4
;;   ;; (add1 -9) ==> -8
;;   (defun add1 (num)
;;     (1+ num))
;;
;; There are a couple of problems with this:
;;   o these tests are often treated as a supplement a textual comment,
;;     so they may not be very rigorous or thorough.
;;   o these tests won't get run very often; so if something breaks, it
;;     may not get detected until days or weeks later.
;;   o the motivation for a test case itself may be unclear, so when
;;     it returns a surprising value down the road, the programmer may
;;     not remember what the test was for in the first place.

;; This module makes it easy for Emacs lisp programmers to write
;; complete, well-documented regression tests and to run them often
;; during the developement and enhancement processes.

;; Here's the idea:
;;   1. The programmer puts one or more test suites directly in the lisp
;;      file, wrapped inside an "eval-when-compile" special form.  This
;;      causes the test suites to be available when .el file is loaded
;;      (or when the buffer is evaluated), but not when the .elc file is
;;      loaded.
;;
;;   2. The programmer runs the tests in one of two ways:
;;        a. Interactively, with the M-x regress command.
;;        b. Automatically, every time the file is evaluated, by putting
;;           a small bit of code at the end of the file.
;;
;;   3. If there are any regressions, a report is produced detailing the
;;      problems.

;; Here's the interface:
;;   M-x regress-insert-suite
;;         Insert a template for a new suite of tests.  Presumably, a
;;         suite appears immediately above the function or functions
;;         that are being tested; but it can appear anywhere--even in a
;;         separate file.
;;   M-x regress-insert-call
;;         Insert code which will cause regression tests to be run when
;;         the .el file is loaded if and only if the "regress" module
;;         has also been loaded.  Presumably, this will appear once at
;;         the end of the .el file; but it can appear anywhere, as many
;;         times as needed, or not at all  if the tests will be run in
;;   M-x regress
;;         Run one or more test suites.  Report any failures.
;;   M-x regress-forget
;;         This doesn't actually delete the test suites, but it does
;;         cause M-x regress to forget that they are test suites so that
;;         they won't appear in the list of suites that can be run.
;;         This can be useful when the programmer has finished work on
;;         one module and is moving on to another.  (The test suites
;;         will get ``remembered'' if the .el file is evaluated again.)

;; Here's the data structures:
;;   Summary:
;;     test-suite  := ([description] [test...])
;;     test        := ([description] probe [':test'] grader)
;;     description := <a string>
;;     probe       := a Lisp expression to perform the actual test.
;;     grader      := a Lisp expression to evaluate whether or not the
;;                    probe was successful.
;;
;;                    If <grader> is preceded by the keyword :test,
;;                    <grader> itself is evaluated, and the test
;;                    passes if the result of non-nil.  For
;;                    convenience, during the evaluation of <grader>,
;;                    a special variable, RESULT, will be bound to the
;;                    result of <probe>.

;;                    Otherwise the test will pass if the result of
;;                    <probe> is equal to <grader>, according to the
;;                    elisp function 'equal'.

;;  Failure indications, new in version 1.5.0.
;;
;;  You can use regress without knowing about failure indications, and
;;  it's probably best to ignore them when you first use regress.  But
;;  as your tests become more complicated, you may wish for an easy
;;  way to know exactly what part of your tests failed.  One way to do
;;  it is to assign to the special variable FAILURE-INDICATION.  If a
;;  regression test fails and FAILURE-INDICATION is non-nil, it will
;;  be printed along with the results.


;; Here are some contrived, simple examples.  Much of regress.el
;; itself contains regression tests.  Search for "eval-when-compile",
;; below.
