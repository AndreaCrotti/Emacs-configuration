;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provide a `tree-widget' useful to display data
;; structures organized in hierarchical order.
;;
;; The following `tree-widget' extra properties are recognized:
;;
;;   :open
;;      Set to non-nil to unfold the tree.  By default the tree is
;;      folded.
;;
;;   :node
;;      The widget used for the tree node.  By default this is an
;;      `item' widget which displays the tree :tag property value if
;;      defined or a string representation of the tree value using the
;;      function `widget-princ-to-string'.
;;
;;   :keep
;;      Specify a list of extra properties to keep when the tree is
;;      folded so they can be recovered when the tree is unfolded.
;;      This property is also honoured in `tree-widget' children.
;;
;;   :dynargs
;;      Specify a function to be called when the tree is unfolded.
;;      This function will receives the tree widget as its argument
;;      and must return a list of children widget definitions.  Thus
;;      dynamlically providing the tree children in response to an
;;      unfold request.  The list of children definitions is kept in
;;      the tree :args property and the :dynargs function can just
;;      return its value when unfolding the tree again.  To force a
;;      new evaluation of the tree content just set its :args property
;;      to nil and redraw the node.
;;
;;   :has-children
;;      Specify if this tree has children.  This property has meaning
;;      only when used with the above :dynargs one.  It indicates that
;;      children widget exist but will be provided when unfolding the
;;      node.
;;
;;   :no-leaf-handle   (default "*---- ")
;;   :close-handle     (default "-- ")
;;   :no-guide         (default "   ")
;;   :open-handle      (default "-, ")
;;   :guide            (default " | ")
;;   :leaf-handle      (default " |--- ")
;;   :last-leaf-handle (default " `--- ")
;;      These properties define the strings used to draw the tree
;;      like the following:
;;
;;      *---- N0        :no-leaf-handle + node
;;
;;      [-]-, N0        node-handle + :open-handle + node
;;          |--- N1     :no-guide + :leaf-handle + node
;;         [-]-, N2     :no-guide + node-handle + :open-handle + node
;;          |  |--- N21 :no-guide + :guide + :leaf-handle + node
;;          |  `--- N22 :no-guide + :guide + :last-leaf-handle + node
;;         [+]-- N3     :no-guide + node-handle + :close-handle + node
;;
;; About leaf node format
;;   To correctly draw the tree, that is insert the current leaf node
;;   prefix, leaf node widgets should prepend the "%p" escape to the
;;   value of the :format property.  And set the :format-handler
;;   property to `tree-widget-format-handler'.  Something like this:
;;
;;   (define-widget 'leaf-node 'item
;;     :format "%p%t\n"
;;     :format-handler #'tree-widget-format-handler)
;;
;; Basic examples of `tree-widget' usage are provided in this file
;; (see commands `tree-widget-example-1' and `tree-widget-example-2').
;; A more sophisticated example is provided in the dir-tree.el
;; source.
;;
;; Installation

;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add following into
;; your ~/.emacs startup file
