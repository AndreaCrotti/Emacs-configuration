;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A heap is a form of efficient self-sorting tree. In particular, the
;; root node is guaranteed to be the highest-ranked entry in the
;; tree. (The comparison function used for ranking the data can, of
;; course, be freely defined). Therefore repeatedly removing the root
;; node will return the data in order of increasing rank. They are often
;; used as priority queues, for scheduling tasks in order of importance.
;;
;; This package implements a ternary heap, since they are about 12% more
;; efficient than binary heaps for heaps containing more than about 10
;; elements., and for very small heaps the difference is negligible. The
;; asymptotic complexity of heap operations is the same as for a binary
;; heap: `add', `delete-root' and `modify' are all O(log n) on a heap
;; containing n elements.
;;
;; Note that this package implements a heap as an implicit data
;; structure on a vector. Therefore, the maximum size of the heap has to
;; be specified in advance. Although the heap will grow dynamically if
;; it becomes full, this requires copying the entire heap, so
;; over-filling the heap is O(n) instead of O(log n).
;;
;; A heap consists of two cons cells, the first one holding the tag
;; 'HEAP in the car cell and the second one having the heap in the car
;; and the compare function in the cdr cell. The compare function must
;; take two arguments of the type which is to be stored in the heap and
;; must return non-nil or nil. To implement a max-heap, it should return
;; non-nil if the first argument is "greater" than the second. To
;; implement a min-heap, it should return non-nil if the first argument
;; is "less than" the second.
;;
;; You create a heap using `heap-create', add elements to it using
;; `heap-add', delete and return the root of the heap using
;; `heap-delete-root', and modify an element of the heap using
;; `heap-modify'. A number of other convenience functions are also
;; provided, all with the prefix `heap-'. Functions with prefix `heap--'
;; are for internal use only, and should never be used outside this
;; package.

;;; Change log:
;;
;; Version 0.2.1
;; * modified Commentary
;;
;; Version 0.2
;; * fixed efficiency issue: vectors are no longer copied all the time
;;   (thanks to Stefan Monnier for pointing this out)
;;
;; Version 0.1.5
;; * renamed `vswap' to `heap--vswap'
;; * removed cl dependency
;;
;; Version 0.1.4
;; * fixed internal function and macro names
;;
;; Version 0.1.3
;; * added more commentary
;;
;; Version 0.1.2
;; * moved defmacros before their first use so byte-compilation works
;;
;; Version 0.1.1
;; * added cl dependency
;;
;; version 0.1
;; * initial release
