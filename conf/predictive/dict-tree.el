;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A dictionary is used to store strings, along with arbitrary data
;; associated with each string. As well as basic data insertion,
;; manipulation and retrieval, a dictionary can perform prefix searches
;; on those strings, retrieving all strings with a given prefix in
;; either alphabetical or any other order (see the `dictree-complete'
;; and `dictree-complete-ordered' functions), and is able to cache
;; results in order to speed up those searches. The package also
;; provides persistent storage of the data structures to files.
;;
;; You create a dictionary using `dictree-create', add entries to it
;; using `dictree-insert', lookup entries using `dictree-lookup', find
;; completions of sequences using `dictree-complete', find completions
;; and sort them in any order you speficy using
;; `dictree-complete-ordered', map over it using `dictree-map' and
;; `dictree-mapcar', save it to a file using `dictree-save' or
;; `dictree-write', and load from file it using `dictree-load'. Various
;; other useful functions are also provided.
;;
;; This package uses the trie package, trie.el.


;;; Change log:
;;
;; Version 0.12.2
;; * bug-fix to DEFAULT argument handling in `read-dict'
;;
;; Version 0.12.1
;; * added `edebug-prin1' and `edebug-prin1-to-string' advice to prevent
;;   edebug hanging whilst printing large dictionaries
;;
;; Version 0.12
;; * complete rewrite using new trie.el library
;;
;; Note: version 0.11.1 dictionaries not compatible with version 0.12
;;       and above
;;
;; Version 0.11.1
;; * set and restore value of `byte-compile-disable-print-circle'
;;   instead of let-binding it, to avoid warnings when compiling
;; * added `dictree-goto-line' macro to work around `goto-line' bug
;;
;; Version 0.11
;; * modified `dictree-write' so that, by default, both compiled and
;;   uncompiled versions of dictionaries are created when writing
;;   dictionaries to file
;; * fixed slow byte-compilation under Emacs 22
;;
;; Version 0.10.2
;; * very minor changes to text of some messages
;;
;; Version 0.10.1
;; * added optional DICTLIST argument to `read-dict', to allow
;;   completion from a restricted set of dictionaries
;;
;; Version 0.10
;; * finally wrote a `dictree-delete' function!
;;
;; Version 0.9.1
;; * fixed bug in `dictree-dump-words-to-buffer' (thanks to Dan Pomohaci
;;   for reporting it)
;; * replaced "word" with "key" in function arguments and docstrings,
;;   since keys don't have to be words
;; * removed "words" from dump functions' names, added TYPE argument in
;;   line with other functions, and made them non-interactive
;; * added COMPARE-FUNCTION argument to `dictree-create', which defaults
;;   to subtraction as before
;; * `dictree-read-line' reads the keys with `read', and no longer evals
;;   the data as this fails for simple, useful cases (e.g. constant
;;   lists)
;;
;; Version 0.9
;; * added meta-dictionary functionality
;; * dictionary data can now be referenced by any sequence type, not
;;   just strings * removed cl dependency
;;
;; Note: version 0.8 dictionaries not compatible with version 0.9 and
;;       above
;;
;; Version 0.8.4
;; * fixed small bug in `read-dict'
;;
;; Version 0.8.3
;; * fixed internal function and macro names
;; * changed naming prefix from dict- to dictree- to avoid conflicts
;; * `dict-write' now unloads old name and reloads new
;;
;; Version 0.8.2
;; * added more commentary
;;
;; Version 0.8.1
;; * fixed nasty bug in `dict-map' and `dict-mapcar' caused by dynamic
;;   scoping
;;
;; Version 0.8
;; * changed `dict-map(car)' into functions and made them work with
;;   lookup-only dicts
;; * `dict-insert' now returns the new data value
;; * rewrote cache data structures: data is now wrapped inside a cons
;;   cell, so that cache entries can point to it instead of duplicating
;;   it. This fixes some caching bugs and makes updating cached data
;;   when inserting words much faster
;; * dictionaries (but not lookup-only) can now associate two pieces of
;;   data with each word: normal data, used to rank words returned by
;;   `dict-complete-ordered', and meta-data, not used for ranking
;; * modified functions to work with new caching and meta-data, and
;;   added `dict-set-meta-data' and `dict-lookup-meta-data'
;; * renamed to `dict-tree' to help avoid conflicts with other packages
;;
;; Version 0.7
;; * added `dict-mapcar' macro
;;
;; Version 0.6.2
;; * minor bug fixes
;;
;; Version 0.6.1
;; * minor bug fixes
;;
;; Version 0.6
;; * added dict-size function
;; * added dict-dump-words-to-buffer function
;; * dictionaries now set their names and filenames by doing a library
;;   search for themselves when loaded using require
;; * added `read-dict' minibuffer completion function
;; * interactive commands that read a dictionary name now provide
;;   completion
;;
;; Version 0.5
;; * added dict-dump-words-to-file function
;;
;; Version 0.4
;; * fixed bug in dict-read-line
;;
;; Version 0.3
;; * added dict-map function
;;
;; Version 0.2
;; * added dictionary autosave flag and related functions;
;; * fixed bug preventing dict caches being loaded properly;
;; * explicitly require cl.el;
;;
;; Note: version 0.1 dictionaries not compatible with version 0.2 and
;;       above!
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * initial release

;;                   Dictionary data cell structures

;; Note: It would be more elegant to use a defstruct for the data cells,
;;       but the problem is that the resulting setf in
;;       `dictree--wrap-insfun' won't get expanded into the cell-data
;;       accessor function at compile-time because it's burried inside a
;;       backquote construct. Not only is it inelegant to have to expand
;;       macros at run-time whenever `dictree--wrap-insfun' is called,
;;       but it also requires the 'cl-macs package to be loaded at
;;       run-time rather than just at compile-time. We could use
;;       `lexical-let' instead, but it doesn't seem worth it here.

  "Create an empty dictionary and return it.

If NAME is supplied, the dictionary is stored in the variable
NAME. Defaults to FILENAME stripped of directory and
extension. (Regardless of the value of NAME, the dictionary will
be stored in the default variable name when it is reloaded from
file.)

FILENAME supplies a directory and file name to use when saving
the dictionary. If the AUTOSAVE flag is non-nil, then the
dictionary will automatically be saved to this file when it is
unloaded or when exiting Emacs.

If UNLISTED is non-nil, the dictionary will not be added to the
list of loaded dictionaries. Note that this disables autosaving.

COMPARE-FUNCTION sets the function used to compare elements of
the keys. It should take two arguments, A and B, both of the type
contained by the sequences used as keys \(e.g. if the keys will
be strings, the function will be passed two characters\). It
should return t if the first is \"less than\" the
second. Defaults to `<'.

INSERT-FUNCTION sets the function used to insert data into the
dictionary. It should take two arguments: the new data, and the
data already in the dictionary, and should return the data to
insert. Defaults to replacing any existing data with the new
data.

RANK-FUNCTION sets the function used to rank the results of
`dictree-complete'. It should take two arguments, each a cons
whose car is a dictree key (a sequence) and whose cdr is the data
associated with that key. It should return non-nil if the first
argument is \"better\" than the second, nil otherwise. It
defaults to \"lexical\" comparison of the keys, ignoring the data
\(which is not very useful, since an unranked `dictree-complete'
query already does this much more efficiently\).

CACHE-POLICY should be a symbol ('time, 'length, or 'both), which
determines which query operations are cached. The 'time setting
caches queries that take longer (in seconds) than the
corresponding CACHE-THRESHOLD value. The 'length setting caches
lookups of key sequences that are longer than
LOOKUP-CACHE-THRESHOLD value (since those are likely to be the
slower ones), and caches completions of prefixes that are shorter
than the corresponding CACHE-THRESHOLD (since those are likely to
be the slower ones in that case). The setting 'both requires both
conditions to be satisfied simultaneously.

CACHE-UPDATE-POLICY should be a symbol ('synchronize or 'delete),
which determines how the caches are updated when data is inserted
or deleted. The former updates tainted cache entries, which makes
queries faster but insertion and deleteion slower, whereas the
latter deletes any tainted cache entries, which makes queries
slower but insertion and deletion faster.

The CACHE-THRESHOLD settings set the threshold for caching the
corresponding dictionary query (lookup, completion, ranked
completion). The meaning of these values depends on the setting
of CACHE-POLICY (see above).

All CACHE-THRESHOLD's default to nil. The values nil and t are
special. If a CACHE-THRESHOLD is set to nil, no caching is done
for that type of query. If it is t, everything is cached for that
type of query \(similar behaviour can be obtained by setting the
CACHE-THRESHOLD to 0, but it is better to use t\).

KEY-SAVEFUN, DATA-SAVEFUN and PLIST-SAVEFUN are functions used to
convert keys, data and property lists into lisp objects that have
a valid read syntax, for writing to file. DATA-SAVEFUN and
PLIST-SAVEFUN are used when saving the dictionary (see
`dictree-save' and `dictree-write'), and all three functions are
used when dumping the contents of the dictionary \(see
`dictree-dump-to-buffer' and `dictree-dump-to-file'\).
KEY-SAVEFUN, DATA-SAVEFUN and PLIST-SAVEFUN should each accept
one argument: a key, data or property list from DICT,
respectively. They should return a lisp object which has a valid
read syntax. When defining these functions, be careful not to
accidentally modify the lisp object in the dictionary; usually,
you will need to make a copy before converting it.

KEY-LOADFUN, DATA-LOADFUN and PLIST-LOADFUN are used to convert
keys, data and property lists back again when loading a
dictionary (only DATA-LOADFUN and PLIST-LOADFUN, see
`dictree-save' and `dictree-write') or populating it from a
file (all three, see `dictree-populate-from-file'). They should
accept one argument: a lisp object of the type produced by the
corresponding SAVEFUN, and return a lisp object to use in the
loaded dictionary.

TRIE-TYPE sets the type of trie to use as the underlying data
structure. See `trie-create' for details."

Back-references and non-greedy postfix operators are *not*

If the regexp contains any non-shy grouping constructs, subgroup
match data is included in the results. In this case, the car of
each match is no longer just a key. Instead, it is a list whose

cf. `dictree-create'). Return nil if no completions are found.

PREFIX can also be a list of sequences, in which case completions of
all elements in the list are returned, merged together in a
single sorted alist.

DICT can also be a list of dictionaries, in which case
completions are sought in all dictionaries in the list. (Note
that if the same key appears in multiple dictionaries, the alist
may contain the same key multiple times, each copy associated
with the data from a different dictionary. If you want to combine
identical keys, use a meta-dictionary; see
`dictree-meta-dict-create'.)

If optional argument RANK-FUNCTION is any non-nil value that is
not a function, the completions are sorted according to the
dictionary's rank-function (see `dictree-create'). Any non-nil
value that *is* a function over-rides this. In that case,
RANK-FUNCTION should accept two arguments, both cons cells. The
car of each contains a sequence from the trie (of the same type
as PREFIX), the cdr contains its associated data. The
RANK-FUNCTION should return non-nil if first argument is ranked
strictly higher than the second, nil otherwise.

The optional integer argument MAXNUM limits the results to the
first MAXNUM completions. The default is to return all matches.

If the optional argument NO-CACHE is non-nil, it prevents caching
of the result. Ignored for dictionaries that do not have
completion caching enabled.

The FILTER argument sets a filter function for the
completions. For each potential completion, it is passed two
arguments: the completion, and its associated data. If the filter
function returns nil, the completion is not included in the
results, and doesn't count towards MAXNUM.

RESULTFUN defines a function used to process results before
adding them to the final result list. If specified, it should
accept two arguments: a key and its associated data. It's return

  "Return an alist containing all matches for REGEXP in TRIE
along with their associated data, in the order defined by
RANKFUN, defauling to \"lexical\" order (i.e. the order defined
by the trie's comparison function).  If REVERSE is non-nil, the
completions are sorted in the reverse order. Returns nil if no
completions are found.

DICT can also be a list of dictionaries, in which case matches
are sought in all dictionaries in the list. (Note that if the
same key appears in multiple dictionaries, the alist may contain
the same key multiple times, each copy associated with the data
from a different dictionary. If you want to combine identical
keys, use a meta-dictionary; see `dictree-meta-dict-create'.)

REGEXP is a regular expression, but it need not necessarily be a
string. It must be a sequence (vector, list of string) whose
elements are either elements of the same type as elements of the
trie keys (which behave as literals in the regexp), or any of the
usual regexp special characters and backslash constructs. If
REGEXP is a string, it must be possible to apply `string' to
individual elements of the keys stored in the trie. The matches
returned in the alist will be sequences of the same type as KEY.

Only a subset of the full Emacs regular expression syntax is
supported. There is no support for regexp constructs that are
only meaningful for strings (character ranges and character
classes inside character alternatives, and syntax-related
backslash constructs). Back-references and non-greedy postfix
operators are not supported, so `?' after a postfix operator
loses its special meaning. Also, matches are always anchored, so
`$' and `^' lose their special meanings (use `.*' at the
beginning and end of the regexp to get an unanchored match).

If the regexp contains any non-shy grouping constructs, subgroup
match data is included in the results. In this case, the car of
each match is no longer just a key. Instead, it is a list whose
first element is the matching key, and whose remaining elements
are cons cells whose cars and cdrs give the start and end indices
of the elements that matched the corresponding groups, in order.

If optional argument RANK-FUNCTION is any non-nil value that is
not a function, the matches are sorted according to the
dictionary's rank-function (see `dictree-create'). Any non-nil
value that *is* a function over-rides this. In that case,
RANK-FUNCTION should accept two arguments, both cons cells. The
car of each contains a sequence from the dictionary (of the same
type as PREFIX), the cdr contains its associated data. The
RANK-FUNCTION should return non-nil if first argument is ranked
strictly higher than the second, nil otherwise.

The optional integer argument MAXNUM limits the results to the
first MAXNUM matches. The default is to return all matches.

If the optional argument NO-CACHE is non-nil, it prevents caching
of the result. Ignored for dictionaries that do not have wildcard
caching enabled.

The FILTER argument sets a filter function for the matches. If
supplied, it is called for each possible match with two
arguments: the matching key, and its associated data. If the
filter function returns nil, the match is not included in the
results, and does not count towards MAXNUM.

RESULTFUN defines a function used to process results before
adding them to the final result list. If specified, t should
accept two arguments: a key and its associated data. It's return
value is what gets added to the final result list, instead of the
default key-data cons cell."

  "Populate dictionary DICT from the key list in file FILE.

Each line of FILE should contain a key, either a string
\(delimeted by \"\), a vector, or a list. (Use the escape
sequence \\\" to include a \" in a string.) If a line does not
contain a key, it is silently ignored.

Each line can optionally include data and a property list (in
that order) to be associated with the key. If present, these
should separated from each other and the key by whitespace.

INSERT-FUNCTION, KEY-LOAD-FUNCTION, DATA-LOAD-FUNCTION and
PLIST-LOAD-FUNCTION override the corresponding default functions
for DICT (see `dictree-create').

Interactively, DICT and FILE are read from the mini-buffer.


Technicalities:

The key, data and property list are read as lisp expressions
using `read'. The keys will be read from FILE in order, unless
BALANCE is non-nil, in which case they are read from the median
element outwards (which can help ensure efficient data structures
are created when using a trie that is not self-balancing, see

;;            Pretty-print dictionaries during edebug

;; We advise the `edebug-prin1' and `edebug-prin1-to-string' functions
;; (actually, aliases) so that they pring "#<dict-tree NAME>" instead of
;; the full print form for dictionaries.
;;
;; This is because, if left to its own devices, edebug hangs for ages
;; whilst printing large dictionaries, and you either have to wait for a
;; *very* long time for it to finish, or kill Emacs entirely. (Even C-g
;; C-g fails!)
;;
;; Since the print form of a dictionary is practically incomprehensible
;; anyway, we don't lose much by doing this. If you *really* want to
;; print dictionaries in full whilst edebugging, despite this warning,
;; disable the advice.

;; FIXME: Should use `cedet-edebug-prin1-extensions' instead of advice
;;        when `cedet-edebug' is loaded, though I believe this still
;;        works in that case.
