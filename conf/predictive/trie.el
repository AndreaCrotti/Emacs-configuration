;; Quick Overview
;; --------------
;; A trie is a data structure used to store keys that are ordered
;; sequences of elements (vectors, lists or strings in Elisp; strings
;; are by far the most common), in such a way that both storage and
;; retrieval are space- and time-efficient. But, more importantly, a
;; variety of more advanced queries can also be performed efficiently:
;; for example, returning all strings with a given prefix, searching for
;; keys matching a given wildcard pattern or regular expression, or
;; searching for all keys that match any of the above to within a given
;; Lewenstein distance (though this last is not yet implemented in this
;; package - code contributions welcome!).
;;
;; You create a ternary search tree using `trie-create', create an
;; association using `trie-insert', retrieve an association using
;; `trie-lookup', and map over a trie using `trie-map', `trie-mapc',
;; `trie-mapcar', or `trie-mapf'. You can find completions of a prefix
;; sequence using `trie-complete', or search for keys matching a regular
;; expression using `trie-regexp-search'. Using `trie-stack', you can
;; create an object that allows the contents of the trie to be used like
;; a stack, useful for building other algorithms on top of tries;
;; `trie-stack-pop' pops elements off the stack one-by-one, in "lexical"
;; order, whilst `trie-stack-push' pushes things onto the
;; stack. Similarly, `trie-complete-stack', and `trie-regexp-stack'
;; create "lexically-ordered" stacks of query results.
;;
;; Note that there are two uses for a trie: as a lookup table, in which
;; case only the presence or absence of a key in the trie is
;; significant, or as an associative array, in which case each key
;; carries some associated data. Libraries for other data structure
;; often only implement lookup tables, leaving it up to you to implement
;; an associative array on top of this (by storing key+data pairs in the
;; data structure's keys, then defining a comparison function that only
;; compares the key part). For a trie, however, the underlying data
;; structures naturally support associative arrays at no extra cost, so
;; this package does the opposite: it implements associative arrays, and
;; leaves it up to you to use them as lookup tables if you so desire.
;;
;;
;; Different Types of Trie
;; -----------------------
;; There are numerous ways to implement trie data structures internally,
;; each with its own time and space trade-offs. By viewing a trie as a
;; tree whose nodes are themselves lookup tables for key elements, this
;; package is able to support all types of trie in a uniform
;; manner. This relies on there existing (or you writing!) an Elisp
;; implementation of the corresponding type of lookup table. The best
;; type of trie to use will depend on what trade-offs are appropriate
;; for your particular application. The following gives an overview of
;; the advantages and disadvantages of various types of trie. (Not all
;; of the underlying lookup tables have been implemented in Elisp yet,
;; so using some of the trie types described below would require writing
;; the missing Elisp package!)
;;
;;
;; One of the most effective all-round implementations of a trie is a
;; ternary search tree, which can be viewed as a tree of binary
;; trees. If basic binary search trees are used for the nodes of the
;; trie, we get a standard ternary search tree. If self-balancing binary
;; trees are used (e.g. AVL or red-black trees), we get a self-balancing
;; ternary search tree. If splay trees are used, we get yet another
;; self-organising variant of a ternary search tree. All ternary search
;; trees have, in common, good space-efficiency. The time-efficiency of
;; the various trie operations is also good, assuming the underlying
;; binary trees are balanced. Under that assumption, all variants of
;; ternary search trees described below have the same asymptotic
;; time-complexity for all trie operations.
;;
;; Self-balancing trees ensure the underlying binary trees are always
;; close to perfectly balanced, with the usual trade-offs between the
;; different the types of self-balancing binary tree: AVL trees are
;; slightly more efficient for lookup operations than red-black trees,
;; at a cost of slightly less efficienct insertion operations, and less
;; efficient deletion operations. Splay trees give good average-case
;; complexity and are simpler to implement than AVL or red-black trees
;; (which can mean they're faster in practice!), at the expense of poor
;; worst-case complexity.
;;
;; If your tries are going to be static (i.e. created once and rarely
;; modified), then using perfectly balanced binary search trees might be
;; appropriate. Perfectly balancing the binary trees is very
;; inefficient, but it only has to be when the trie is first created or
;; modified. Lookup operations will then be as efficient as possible for
;; ternary search trees, and the implementation will also be simpler (so
;; probably faster) than a self-balancing tree, without the space and
;; time overhead required to keep track of rebalancing.
;;
;; On the other hand, adding data to a binary search tree in a random
;; order usually results in a reasonably balanced tree. If this is the
;; likely scenario, using a basic binary tree without bothering to
;; balance it at all might be quite efficient, and, being even simpler
;; to implement, could be quite fast overall.
;;
;;
;; A digital trie is a different implementation of a trie, which can be
;; viewed as a tree of arrays, and has different space- and
;; time-complexities than a ternary search tree. Roughly speaking, a
;; digital trie has worse space-complexity, but better
;; time-complexity. Using hash tables instead of arrays for the nodes
;; gives something similar to a digital trie, potentially with better
;; space-complexity and the same amortised time-complexity, but at the
;; expense of occasional significant inefficiency when inserting and
;; deleting (whenever a hash table has to be resized). Indeed, an array
;; can be viewed as a perfect hash table, but as such it requires the
;; number of possible values to be known in advance.
;;
;; Finally, if you really need optimal efficiency from your trie, you
;; could even write a custom type of underlying lookup table, optimised
;; for your specific needs.
;;
;;
;; This package uses the AVL tree package avl-tree.el, the tagged NFA
;; package tNFA.el, and the heap package heap.el.


;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.2.2
;; * added `edebug-prin1' and `edebug-prin1-to-string' advice to prevent
;;   edebug hanging whilst printing large tries
;;
;; Version 0.2.1
;; * bug-fix to result accumulation in `trie--do-regexp-search'
;;
;; Version 0.2
;; * Replaced wildcard searches with regexp searches, using the tNFA.el
;;   tagged non-deterministic finite state automata library. This is
;;   both more general *and* more efficient.
;; * Bug fix in `trie--do-regexp-search'
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * Initial release (complete rewrite from scratch of tstree.el!)
;; * Ternary search trees are now implemented as a tree of avl trees,
;;   which has numerous advantages: self-balancing trees guarantee
;;   O(log n) complexity regardless of how the tree is built; deletion
;;   is now done properly.
;; * unlike tstree.el, trie.el is general enough to implement all sorts
;;   of tries, not just ternary search trees (though these remain the
;;   default).
;; * Up to "tstree"->"trie" renaming, many functions are drop-in
;;   replacements for tstree.el functions. However, insertion and rank
;;   functions are no longer stored in the data structure, so
;;   corresponidng arguments are no longer optional. A single
;;   `trie-complete' function now deals with sorting completions in both
;;   lexical or arbitrary order, the ranking function being passed as an
;;   optional argument in the latter case. And functions can no longer
;;   operate over multiple data structures at once; i.e. they no longer
;;   accept lists of trees as arguments. (These features belong in
;;   higher level libraries, and the efficiency loss is negligible.)
;; * `trie-wildcard-search' implements efficient shell-glob-like
;;   wildcard searches of tries!

arguments, each being an element of such a sequence, and return t
if the first is strictly smaller than the second.

The optional argument TYPE specifies the type of trie to
create. However, the only one that is currently implemented is
the default, so this argument is useless. (See also
`trie-create-custom'.)")



(defalias 'trie-create-custom 'trie--create-custom
  "Return a new trie that uses comparison function COMPARISON-FUNCTION.

A trie stores sequences (strings, vectors or lists) along with
associated data. COMPARISON-FUNCTION should accept two arguments,
each being an element of such a sequence, and return t if the
first is strictly smaller than the second.

The remaining keyword arguments: :CREATEFUN, :INSERTFUN, :DELETEFUN,
:LOOKUPFUN, :MAPFUN, :EMPTYFUN, :STACK-CREATEFUN, :STACK-POPFUN,
:STACK-EMPTYFUN, :TRANSFORM-FOR-PRINT and :TRANSFORM-FROM-READ
determine the type of trie that is created.

CREATEFUN is called as follows:

  (CREATEFUN COMPARISON-FUNCTION SEQ)

and should return a data structure (\"ARRAY\") that can be used
as an associative array, where two elements A and B are equal if
the following is non-nil:

  (and (COMPARISON-FUNCTION b a)
       (COMPARISON-FUNCTION b a))

The SEQ argument is a vector containing the sequence that will
correspond to the newly created array in the trie. For most types
of trie, this value is ignored. It is passed to CREATEFUN only in
order to allow the creation of \"hybrid\" trie structures, in
which different types of associative array are used in different
parts of the trie. For example, the type of associative array
could be chosen based on the depth in the trie, given by \(length
SEQ\). (Note that all the other functions described below must be
able to correctly handle *any* of the types of associate array
that might be created by CREATEFUN.)

INSERTFUN, DELETEFUN, LOOKUPFUN, MAPFUN and EMPTYFUN should
insert, delete, lookup, map over, and check-if-there-exist-any
elements in an associative array. They are called as follows:

  (INSERTFUN array element &optional updatefun)
  (DELETEFUN array element &optional predicate nilflag)
  (LOOKUPFUN array element &optional nilflag)
  (MAPFUN function array &optional reverse)
  (EMPTYFUN array)

INSERTFUN should insert ELEMENT into ARRAY and return the new
element, which will be ELEMENT itself unless UPDATEFUN is
specified. In that case, if and only if an element matching
ELEMENT already exists in the associative array, INSERTFUN should
instead pass ELEMENT and the matching element as arguments to
UPDATEFUN, replace the matching element with the return value,
and return that return value.

DELETEFUN should delete the element in the associative array that
matches ELEMENT, and return the deleted element. However, if
PREDICATE is specified and a matching element exists in ARRAY,
DELETEFUN should first pass the matching element as an argument
to PREDICATE before deleting, and should only delete the element
if PREDICATE returns non-nil. DELETEFUN should return NILFLAG if
no element was deleted (either becuase no matching element was
found, or because TESTFUN returned nil).

LOOKUPFUN should return the element from the associative array
that matches ELEMENT, or NILFLAG if no matching element exists.

MAPFUN should map FUNCTION over all elements in the order defined by
COMPARISON-FUNCTION, or in reverse order if REVERSE is non-nil.


STACK-CREATEFUN, STACK-POPFUN and STACK-EMPTYFUN should allow the
associative array to be used as a stack. STACK-CREATEFUN is
called as follows:

  (STACK-CREATEFUN array)

and should return a data structure (\"STACK\") that behaves like
a sorted stack of all elements in the associative array. I.e.
successive calls to

  (STACK-POPFUN stack)

should return elements from the associative array in the order
defined by COMPARISON-FUNCTION, and

  (STACK-EMPTYFUN stack)

should return non-nil if the stack is empty, nil otherwise.

The stack functions are optional, in that all trie operations
other than the stack-related ones will work correctly. However,
any code that makes use of trie-stacks will complain if supplied
with this type of trie.


The :TRANSFORM-FOR-PRINT and :TRANSFORM-FROM-READ arguments are
optional. If supplied, they can be used to transform the trie
into a format suitable for passing to Elisp's `print'
functions (typically used to persistently store the trie by
writing it to file), and transform from that format back to the
original usable form.

functions must *never* bind any variables with names commencing
\"--\".")

PREFIX must be a sequence (vector, list or string) that forms the

Note that any modification to TRIE *immediately* invalidates all

calling `trie-stack-pop' will give unpredictable results).

Operations on trie-stacks are significantly more efficient than
constructing a real stack from completions of PREFIX in TRIE and
using standard stack functions. As such, they can be useful in

(defun trie-regexp-search

  "Return an alist containing all matches for REGEXP in TRIE
along with their associated data, in the order defined by
RANKFUN, defauling to \"lexical\" order (i.e. the order defined
by the trie's comparison function).  If REVERSE is non-nil, the
completions are sorted in the reverse order. Returns nil if no
completions are found.

REGEXP is a regular expression, but it need not necessarily be a
string. It must be a sequence (vector, list of string) whose
elements are either elements of the same type as elements of the
trie keys (which behave as literals in the regexp), or any of the
usual regexp special characters and backslash constructs. If
REGEXP is a string, it must be possible to apply `string' to
individual elements of the keys stored in the trie. The matches
returned in the alist will be sequences of the same type as KEY.

Only a subset of the full Emacs regular expression syntax is
supported. There is no support for regexp constructs that are
only meaningful for strings (character ranges and character
classes inside character alternatives, and syntax-related
backslash constructs). Back-references and non-greedy postfix
operators are not supported, so `?' after a postfix operator
loses its special meaning. Also, matches are always anchored, so
`$' and `^' lose their special meanings (use `.*' at the
beginning and end of the regexp to get an unanchored match).

If the regexp contains any non-shy grouping constructs, subgroup
match data is included in the results. In this case, the car of
each match (as returned by a call to `trie-stack-pop' is no
longer just a key. Instead, it is a list whose first element is
the matching key, and whose remaining elements are cons cells
whose cars and cdrs give the start and end indices of the
elements that matched the corresponding groups, in order.

The optional integer argument MAXNUM limits the results to the
first MAXNUM matches. Otherwise, all matches are returned.

If specified, RANKFUN must accept two arguments, both cons
cells. The car contains a sequence from the trie (of the same

the second, nil otherwise.
