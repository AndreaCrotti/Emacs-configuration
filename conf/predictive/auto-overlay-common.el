(defun auto-overlays-at-point (&optional point prop-test inactive)
  "Return overlays overlapping POINT
(or the point, if POINT is null). If PROP-TEST is supplied, it
should be a list which specifies a property test with one of the
following forms (or a list of such lists if more than one
property test is required):

  (FUNCTION PROPERTY)

  (FUNCTION PROPERTY VALUE)

  (FUNCTION (PROPERTY1 PROPERTY2 ...) (VALUE1 VALUE2 ...))

where PROPERTY indicates an overlay property name (a symbol), and
VALUE indicates an arbitrary value or lisp expression.

For each overlay overlapping POINT, first the values
corresponding to the property names are retrieved from the
overlay, then FUNCTION is called with the properties values
followed by the other values as its arguments. The test is
satisfied if the result is non-nil, otherwise it fails. Tests are
evaluated in order, but only up to the first failure. Only
overlays that satisfy all property tests are returned.

If INACTIVE is non-nil, both active and inactive overlays are
returned (usually inactive ones are ignored).

Note that this function returns any overlay. If you want to
restrict it to auto overlays, include '(identity auto-overlay) in
PROP-TEST."
