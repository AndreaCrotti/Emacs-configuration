;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.2.8
;; * renamed 'entry-id and 'subentry-id to 'definition-id and 'regexp-id
;;
;; Version 0.2.7
;; * fixed bug in `auto-o-parse-self-match' which caused a matched self match
;;   to have null 'parent property if a new self match was created inside an
;;   existing self overlay
;;
;; Version 0.2.6
;; * set overlay properties straight after creation in `auto-o-make-self',
;;   rather than leaving it to `auto-overlay-update', in case matching causes
;;   exclusive reparsing, for which properties are already required
;;
;; Version 0.2.5
;; * removed `auto-overlay-functions' and changed to use new interface
;;
;; Version 0.2.4
;; * fixed(?) bug in auto-o-self-list that caused it to
;;   sometimes miss out the parent overlay itself from the list
;;
;; Version 0.2.3
;; * updated to reflect changes in `auto-overlays.el'
;; * changed `auto-o-self-list' to make it run faster
;;
;; Version 0.2.2
;; * small but important bug fix
;;
;; Version 0.2.1
;; * bug fixes
;;
;; Version 0.2
;; * substantially re-written to postpone cascading until absolutely
;;   necessary, for improved responsiveness
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * initial version separated off from auto-overlays.el
