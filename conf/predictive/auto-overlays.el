;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.9.8
;; * modified `auto-o-run-after-change-functions' to ignore all changes that
;;   aren't either insertions or deletions (were these behind some of the
;;   undo-related bugs?!?)
;; * added horrible hack to `auto-o-run-after-change-functions' to delete all
;;   marker update entries in most recent `buffer-undo-list' change group,
;;   since undoing these can badly mess up the overlays
;;
;; Version 0.9.7
;; * added `auto-o-schedule-delete-in-front-or-behind-suicide' to simulate
;;   missing `delete-in-front-hooks' and `delete-behind-hooks' overlay
;;   properties
;;
;; Version 0.9.6
;; * bug-fix in `auto-overlay-load-definition'
;;
;; Version 0.9.5
;; * bug-fixes in `auto-overlay-save-overlays' and `auto-overlay-load-overlays'
;;
;; Version 0.9,4
;; * made inequalities strict in `auto-o-overlapping-match' (fixes a bug, but
;;   does it introduce others?!)
;;
;; Version 0.9.3
;; * fixed bug in `auto-overlay-unload-definition'
;;
;; Version 0.9.2
;; * allow SAVE-FILE argument of `auto-overlay-start/stop' to specify a
;;   location to save to
;; * made corresponding modifications to `auto-overlay-save/load-overlays'
;; * work around `goto-line' bug to prevent mark being set and message being
;;   displayed by `auto-overlay-update'
;;
;; Version 0.9.1
;; * modified `completion-unload-definition/regexp' functions so that they
;;   return the unloaded definition/regexp in a form suitable for re-loading
;;   via `completion-load-definition/regexp'
;;
;; Version 0.9
;; * simplified interface functions for loading and unloading auto-overlay
;;   definitions (functions are now called `auto-overlay-load-definition',
;;   `auto-overlay-load-regexp', `auto-overlay-unload-set',
;;   `auto-overlay-unload-definition', `auto-overlay-unload-regexp')
;;
;; Version 0.8.2
;; * fixed bug that arose when buffer was narrowed by widening before
;;   scheduling updates and before parsing lines in `auto-overlay-update'
;; * fixed `auto-overlay-load-overlays' so that it doesn't parse matches that
;;   are within higher priority exclusive overlays
;; * improved update scheduling by collapsing updates for overlapping regions
;; * fixed `auto-o-match-overlay' and `auto-o-suicide' to remove properties
;;   due to old matches before setting new properties
;; * fixed `auto-o-match-overlay' so that it sets parent property correctly
;;   when old start/end overlay is the new end/start overlay (as happens when
;;   'self regexps are cascaded)
;;
;; Version 0.8.1
;; * modified `auto-o-run-after-change-functions' to cope more robustly with
;;   the pending functions that it calls themselves scheduling other functions
;;
;; Version 0.8
;; * modified to allow sets of regexps that are shared between buffers to be
;;   enabled and disabled independently in each of those buffers
;; * abstracted access to the `auto-overlay-regexps' variable into accessor
;;   macros, as much as possible
;;
;; Version 0.7.2
;; * added md5 sum check for regexps to `auto-overlay-load-overlays', to
;;   ensure regexp definitions haven't changed since overlays were saved
;;
;; Version 0.7.1
;; * fixed sharing of regexp sets
;;
;; Version 0.7
;; * fixed bugs in `auto-o-update-exclusive' that caused it to fail if called
;;   during a suicide when parentless overlays can exist, and that caused it
;;   to infinitely recurse if an exclusive overlay partially overlapped with
;;   its match overlay (thanks to Aemon Cannon for pointing this out)
;; * removed `auto-overlay-functions' variable, and implemented new interface
;;   based on symbol properties
;;
;; Version 0.6.1
;; * fixed minor bug in `auto-overlay-save-overlays'
;;
;; Version 0.6
;; * rationalised terminology: type -> entry, sequence -> subentry/rank
;; * got rid of mostly useless `auto-overlay-list'
;; * regexp entries and corresponding overlays are now identified by a unique
;;   ID instead of simply their position in the `auto-overlay-regexps' list
;; * added functions for loading and unloading regexps on the fly, possible
;;   with the new ID identifiers
;; * finally added functions for saving and loading overlays to a file (though
;;   the small change to `auto-o-self-list' in auto-overlay-self.el makes a
;;   bigger difference to the load time)
;;
;; Version 0.5
;; * changed the way suicide, update and other functions are called after a
;;   buffer modification: now called from `auto-o-run-after-change-functions'
;;
;; Version 0.4.2
;; * moved compatability code to auto-overlays-compat.el
;;
;; Version 0.4.1
;; * moved defmacros before their first use so byte-compilation works
;;
;; Version 0.4
;; * (a lot of) bug fixes
;;
;; Version 0.3
;; * completely re-written after realising that the match overlays, not the
;;   auto overlays themselves, should be the "primary" objects - much better!
;; * moved code for specific overlay types into separate files
;; * as a side effect, created a mechanism for defining new overlay types
;;   without modifying the auto-overlay code itself
;;
;; Version 0.2:
;; * added exclusive overlay support
;; * major code tidying and bug fixes
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * initial version created by copying code from Predictive Completion
;;   package, with minor modifications

If POS is nil, DEFINITION is added at the end of the list of

beginning. If it is an integer, it is added at that position in
the list. The position in the list makes no difference to the
behaviour of the auto-overlays. But it can make a difference to
the speed and efficiency. In general, higher-priority and
