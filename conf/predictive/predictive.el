;;

;;   weights
;; * remove `predictive-max-completions' customization option, long since

;; * enhanced the prefix definition functions
;; * changed `predictive-auto-learn' to work with new completion-UI
;;   accept/reject hooks
;; * a word can now be learned even if its completion was rejected, by

;; * added `predictive-auto-define-prefixes' feature, which automatically

;;   as the word it's a prefix of
;; * added `predictive-dict-autosave-on-kill-buffer/disable-mode'
;;   customization options to allow more control over when modified
;;   dictionaries are saved
;; * `predictive-unload-dict' now features completion on names of dictionaries
;;   associated with current buffer

;; * finally wrote a `predictive-remove-from-dict' function!

character, regardless of accents or other diacritics, to be
equivalent. See also `predictive-auto-correction-no-completion'

`predictive-equivalent-characters' works by substituting a
character alternative listing all the equivalent characters

provides a more convenient way of defining these commonly used

i.e. later expansions are *not* applied to the replacement text
of previous expansions. Case is always significant.

The expansions themselves can be regexp fragments, and can
include regexp special characters. However, only a subset of the
full Emacs regular expression syntax is supported. There is no
support for regexp constructs that are only meaningful for
strings (character ranges and character classes inside character
alternatives, and syntax-related backslash
constructs). Back-references and non-greedy postfix operators are
not supported, so `?' after a postfix operator loses its special
meaning. Also, matches are always anchored, so `$' and `^' lose
their special meanings (use `.*' at the beginning and end of the
regexp to get an unanchored match).

If the original prefix contains any regexp special characters,
they are quoted using `\\' *before* the prefix expansions are
applied.

Expansions produced by `predictive-equivalent-characters' are
effectively added on to the end of
`predictive-prefix-expansions', so any expansions defined in the

Predictive Completion mode implements predictive text completion,
in an attempt to save on typing. It looks up completions for the
word currently being typed in a dictionary.

Although the English dictionary supplied with the Predictive
Completion Mode package gives quite good results \"out of the
box\", for best results you're strongly encouraged to create your
own dictionaries and train them on your own text. See the Predictive
Completion Manual for more information.

See the `predictive' and `completion-ui' customization groups for
documentation on the many and various configuration options, and
the Predictive Completion Manual for fuller information.

When `predictive-auto-complete' is enabled, words will
automatically be completed as you type. Otherwise, to complete
the word at or next to the point, the following keys can be used:
  \\<predictive-map>
  \\[complete-predictive] \t Complete word at point.

When completing a word, the following keys are available:\

  \\<completion-overlay-map>
  \\[completion-cycle] \t\t Cycle through completions.
  \\[completion-cycle-backwards] \t Cycle backwards through completions.
  \\[completion-accept] \t\t Accept the current completion.
  \\[completion-reject] \t Reject the current completion.
  \\[completion-tab-complete] \t\t\t Insert longest common substring.
  \\[completion-extend-prefix] \t\t Extend the prefix and re-complete.\
  \\<completion-tooltip-map>
  \\[completion-activate-tooltip] \t\t Display the completion tooltip.\
  \\<completion-tooltip-active-map>
  \\[completion-tooltip-cycle] \t\t Scroll through completions in the tooltip.
  \\[completion-tooltip-cycle-backwards] \t\t\t Scroll backwards through completions in the tooltip.\
  \\<completion-menu-map>
  \\[completion-activate-menu] \t\t Display the completion menu.\
  \\<completion-popup-frame-map>
  \\[completion-activate-popup-frame] \t\t Display the completion pop-up frame.

When within a pop-up frame:\

  \\<completion-popup-frame-mode-map>
  \\[completion-popup-frame-toggle-show-all] \t\t Toggle between displing all completions.
  \\[completion-popup-frame-dismiss] \t\t Dismiss the completion pop-up frame."
