;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.1.4
;; * renamed 'entry-id and 'subentry-id to 'definition-id and 'regexp-id
;;
;; Version 0.1.3
;; * set overlay properties straight after creation, rather than leaving it to
;;   `auto-overlay-update', in case overlay is exclusive and we reparse, for
;;   which properties are already required
;;
;; Version 0.1.2
;; * removed `auto-overlay-functions' and changed to use new interface
;;
;; Version 0.1.1
;; * updated to reflect changes in `auto-overlays.el'
;;
;; Version 0.1:
;; * initial version separated off from auto-overlays.el



;;; Code:

    (overlay-put o-new 'start o-match)
    (overlay-put o-match 'parent o-new)

    ;; if new overlay is exclusive, delete lower priority overlays within it
    (when (and (overlay-get o-new 'exclusive)
	       (/= (overlay-start o-new) (overlay-end o-new)))
