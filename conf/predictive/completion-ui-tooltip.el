;;; Commentary:

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.1.1
;; * bug-fix to `completion-cancel-tooltip' to prevent
;;   `completion-tooltip-map' keys from being incorrectly disabled
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * initial version (split off from completion-ui.el)


;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))

(provide 'completion-ui-tooltip)
(require 'completion-ui)

The function is called with three arguments, the prefix,
completions, and index of the currently active completion. It
should return a string containing the text to be displayed in the
tooltip.

Note: this can be overridden by an \"overlay local\" binding (see
`auto-overlay-local-binding').")

These key bindings also get added to the completion overlay keymap.")

;;; ============================================================
;;;                   Setup default keymaps

;; Note on key bindings:
;;
;; `completion-tooltip-active' is reset by `pre-command-hook' (see end of
;; file), so the keymap below is disabled before every command is
;; executed. However, the key bindings are looked up before `pre-command-hook'
;; runs, so the first key sequence after displaying a tooltip has a chance of
;; running something from here. This is exactly what we want, since Emacs
;; hides tooltips after every command and we only want this keymap to be
;; active if a tooltip is visible.
;;
;; The cycling commands bound below re-display the completion tooltip, which
;; causes `completion-tooltip-active' to be set to non-nil again. So after
;; they've run, the keymap is left active again for the next key sequence.
;;
;; Unfortunately, a bug in all known versions of Emacs prevents keymaps from
;; being activated by timers, so this doesn't work when the tooltip is
;; auto-displayed. To work around this, we also bind the cycling commands in
;; `completion-overlay-map'.


;; Set default key bindings for the keymap used when a completion tooltip
;; is displayed, unless it's already been set (most likely in an init
;; file). This keymap is active when `completion-tooltip-active' is
;; non-nil.
