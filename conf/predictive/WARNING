************   The dumped dictionary backup files from old versions of the
* WARNING! *   predictive package are *NOT* compatible with this
************   version. You have to convert the dumped file format to the
new format before recreating your dictionaries in this new version.

If you do not do this, you will lose any prefix relationships defined in
the dictionary (see Relationships between Words, Emacs Predictive
Completion Manual) when you recreate the dictionary, though you will
still be able to recreate the same contents and word weights.

I know I promised the dump format was guaranteed to be portable between
predictive versions. I lied.

To port a dictionary to the new version, use the following procedure:

1. backup the dictionay using `predictive-dump-dict-to-file' as just
   described, using the *old* version of the predictive package;

2. start Emacs;

3. load the "predictive-convert-dump-format" library (included in this
   version of the predictive completion package) using "M-x load-file
   /path/to/predictive-convert-dump-format.el";

4. open the dumped dictionary backup file in Emacs;

5. run the `predictive-convert-dump-format' command;

6. recreate the dictionary using the `predictive-create-dict'
   command (see Creating Dictionaries, Predictive Completion Manual).

Repeat this procedure for each dictionary that you want to port to this
new version.
