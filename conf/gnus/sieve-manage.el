;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides an elisp API for the managesieve network
;; protocol.
;;
;; It uses the SASL library for authentication, which means it
;; supports DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, SCRAM-MD5, NTLM, PLAIN and LOGIN
;; methods.  STARTTLS is not well tested, but should be easy to get to
;; work if someone wants.
;;
;; The API should be fairly obvious for anyone familiar with the
;; managesieve protocol, interface functions include:
;;
;; `sieve-manage-open'
;; open connection to managesieve server, returning a buffer to be
;; used by all other API functions.
;;
;; `sieve-manage-opened'
;; check if a server is open or not
;;
;; `sieve-manage-close'
;; close a server connection.
;;
;; `sieve-manage-authenticate'
;; `sieve-manage-listscripts'
;; `sieve-manage-deletescript'
;; `sieve-manage-getscript'
;; performs managesieve protocol actions
;;
;; and that's it.  Example of a managesieve session in *scratch*:
;;
;; (setq my-buf (sieve-manage-open "my.server.com"))
;; " *sieve* my.server.com:2000*"
;;
;; (sieve-manage-authenticate "myusername" "mypassword" my-buf)
;; 'auth
;;
;; (sieve-manage-listscripts my-buf)
;; ("vacation" "testscript" ("splitmail") "badscript")
