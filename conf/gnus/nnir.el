;; Maybe (info "(gnus)Combined Groups") for a general description.
;; `gnus-group-make-nnir-group' might be described in (info
;; "(gnus)Foreign Groups") as well.


;; The most recent version of this can always be fetched from the Gnus
;; repository.  See http://www.gnus.org/ for more information.

;; This code is still in the development stage but I'd like other
;; people to have a look at it.  Please do not hesitate to contact me
;; with your ideas.

;; What does it do?  Well, it allows you to index your mail using some
;; search engine (freeWAIS-sf, swish-e and others -- see later),
;; then type `G G' in the Group buffer and issue a query to the search
;; engine.  You will then get a buffer which shows all articles
;; matching the query, sorted by Retrieval Status Value (score).

;; When looking at the retrieval result (in the Summary buffer) you
;; can type `G T' (aka M-x gnus-summary-nnir-goto-thread RET) on an
;; article.  You will be teleported into the group this article came
;; from, showing the thread this article is part of.  (See below for
;; restrictions.)

;; The Lisp installation is simple: just put this file on your
;; load-path, byte-compile it, and load it from ~/.gnus or something.
;; This will install a new command `G G' in your Group buffer for
;; searching your mail.  Note that you also need to configure a number
;; of variables, as described below.

;; Restrictions:
;;
;; * If you don't use HyREX as your search engine, this expects that
;;   you use nnml or another one-file-per-message backend, because the
;;   others doesn't support nnfolder.
;; * It can only search the mail backend's which are supported by one
;;   search engine, because of different query languages.
;; * There are restrictions to the Wais setup.
;; * There are restrictions to the imap setup.
;; * gnus-summary-nnir-goto-thread: Fetches whole group first, before
;;   limiting to the right articles.  This is much too slow, of
;;   course.  May issue a query for number of articles to fetch; you
;;   must accept the default of all articles at this point or things
;;   may break.

;; The Lisp setup involves setting a few variables and setting up the
;; search engine. You can define the variables in the server definition
;; like this :
;;   (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '(
;;       (nnimap "" (nnimap-address "localhost")
;;                  (nnir-search-engine hyrex)
;;                  (nnir-hyrex-additional-switches ("-d" "ddl-nnimap.xml"))
;;       )))
;; Or you can define the global ones. The variables set in the mailer-
;; definition will be used first.
;; The variable to set is `nnir-search-engine'.  Choose one of the engines
;; listed in `nnir-engines'.  (Actually `nnir-engines' is an alist,
;; type `C-h v nnir-engines RET' for more information; this includes
;; examples for setting `nnir-search-engine', too.)
;;
;; The variable nnir-mail-backend isn't used anymore.
;;

;; You must also set up a search engine.  I'll tell you about the two
;; search engines currently supported:

;; 1. freeWAIS-sf
;;
;; As always with freeWAIS-sf, you need a so-called `format file'.  I
;; use the following file:
;;
;; ,-----
;; | # Kai's format file for freeWAIS-sf for indexing mails.
;; | # Each mail is in a file, much like the MH format.
;; |
;; | # Document separator should never match -- each file is a document.
;; | record-sep: /^@this regex should never match@$/
;; |
;; | # Searchable fields specification.
;; |
;; | region: /^[sS]ubject:/ /^[sS]ubject: */
;; |         subject "Subject header" stemming TEXT BOTH
;; | end: /^[^ \t]/
;; |
;; | region: /^([tT][oO]|[cC][cC]):/ /^([tT][oO]|[cC][cC]): */
;; |         to "To and Cc headers" SOUNDEX BOTH
;; | end: /^[^ \t]/
;; |
;; | region: /^[fF][rR][oO][mM]:/ /^[fF][rR][oO][mM]: */
;; |         from "From header" SOUNDEX BOTH
;; | end: /^[^ \t]/
;; |
;; | region: /^$/
;; |         stemming TEXT GLOBAL
;; | end: /^@this regex should never match@$/
;; `-----
;;
;; 1998-07-22: waisindex would dump core on me for large articles with
;; the above settings.  I used /^$/ as the end regex for the global
;; field.  That seemed to work okay.

;; There is a Perl module called `WAIS.pm' which is available from
;; CPAN as well as ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de:/pub/wais/Perl.  This
;; module comes with a nifty tool called `makedb', which I use for
;; indexing.  Here's my `makedb.conf':
;;
;; ,-----
;; | # Config file for makedb
;; |
;; | # Global options
;; | waisindex = /usr/local/bin/waisindex
;; | wais_opt  = -stem -t fields
;; | # `-stem' option necessary when `stemming' is specified for the
;; | # global field in the *.fmt file
;; |
;; | # Own variables
;; | homedir = /home/kai
;; |
;; | # The mail database.
;; | database        = mail
;; | files           = `find $homedir/Mail -name \*[0-9] -print`
;; | dbdir           = $homedir/.wais
;; | limit           = 100
;; `-----
;;
;; The Lisp setup involves the `nnir-wais-*' variables.  The most
;; difficult to understand variable is probably
;; `nnir-wais-remove-prefix'.  Here's what it does: the output of
;; `waissearch' basically contains the file name and the (full)
;; directory name.  As Gnus works with group names rather than
;; directory names, the directory name is transformed into a group
;; name as follows: first, a prefix is removed from the (full)
;; directory name, then all `/' are replaced with `.'.  The variable
;; `nnir-wais-remove-prefix' should contain a regex matching exactly
;; this prefix.  It defaults to `$HOME/Mail/' (note the trailing
;; slash).

;; 2. Namazu
;;
;; The Namazu backend requires you to have one directory containing all
;; index files, this is controlled by the `nnir-namazu-index-directory'
;; variable.  To function the `nnir-namazu-remove-prefix' variable must
;; also be correct, see the documentation for `nnir-wais-remove-prefix'
;; above.
;;
;; It is particularly important not to pass any any switches to namazu
;; that will change the output format.  Good switches to use include
;; `--sort', `--ascending', `--early' and `--late'.  Refer to the Namazu
;; documentation for further information on valid switches.
;;
;; To index my mail with the `mknmz' program I use the following
;; configuration file:
;;
;; ,----
;; | package conf;  # Don't remove this line!
;; |
;; | # Paths which will not be indexed. Don't use `^' or `$' anchors.
;; | $EXCLUDE_PATH = "spam|sent";
;; |
;; | # Header fields which should be searchable. case-insensitive
;; | $REMAIN_HEADER = "from|date|message-id|subject";
;; |
;; | # Searchable fields. case-insensitive
;; | $SEARCH_FIELD = "from|date|message-id|subject";
;; |
;; | # The max length of a word.
;; | $WORD_LENG_MAX = 128;
;; |
;; | # The max length of a field.
;; | $MAX_FIELD_LENGTH = 256;
;; `----
;;
;; My mail is stored in the directories ~/Mail/mail/, ~/Mail/lists/ and
;; ~/Mail/archive/, so to index them I go to the directory set in
;; `nnir-namazu-index-directory' and issue the following command.
;;
;;      mknmz --mailnews ~/Mail/archive/ ~/Mail/mail/ ~/Mail/lists/
;;
;; For maximum searching efficiency I have a cron job set to run this
;; command every four hours.

;; 3. HyREX
;;
;; The HyREX backend requires you to have one directory from where all
;; your relative paths are to, if you use them. This directory must be
;; set in the `nnir-hyrex-index-directory' variable, which defaults to
;; your home directory. You must also pass the base, class and
;; directory options or simply your dll to the `nnir-hyrex-programm' by
;; setting the `nnir-hyrex-additional-switches' variable accordently.
;; To function the `nnir-hyrex-remove-prefix' variable must also be
;; correct, see the documentation for `nnir-wais-remove-prefix' above.

;; 4. find-grep
;;
;; The find-grep engine simply runs find(1) to locate eligible
;; articles and searches them with grep(1).  This, of course, is much
;; slower than using a proper search engine but OTOH doesn't require
;; maintenance of an index and is still faster than using any built-in
;; means for searching.  The method specification of the server to
;; search must include a directory for this engine to work (E.g.,
;; `nnml-directory').  The tools must be POSIX compliant.  GNU Find
;; prior to version 4.2.12 (4.2.26 on Linux due to incorrect ARG_MAX
;; handling) does not work.
;; ,----
;; |    ;; find-grep configuration for searching the Gnus Cache
;; |
;; |	(nnml "cache"
;; |          (nnml-get-new-mail nil)
;; |          (nnir-search-engine find-grep)
;; |          (nnml-directory "~/News/cache/")
;; |          (nnml-active-file "~/News/cache/active"))
;; `----

;; Developer information:

;; I have tried to make the code expandable.  Basically, it is divided
;; into two layers.  The upper layer is somewhat like the `nnvirtual'
;; or `nnkiboze' backends: given a specification of what articles to
;; show from another backend, it creates a group containing exactly
;; those articles.  The lower layer issues a query to a search engine
;; and produces such a specification of what articles to show from the
;; other backend.

;; The interface between the two layers consists of the single
;; function `nnir-run-query', which just selects the appropriate
;; function for the search engine one is using.  The input to
;; `nnir-run-query' is a string, representing the query as input by
;; the user.  The output of `nnir-run-query' is supposed to be a
;; vector, each element of which should in turn be a three-element
;; vector.  The first element should be full group name of the article,
;; the second element should be the article number, and the third
;; element should be the Retrieval Status Value (RSV) as returned from
;; the search engine.  An RSV is the score assigned to the document by
;; the search engine.  For Boolean search engines, the
;; RSV is always 1000 (or 1 or 100, or whatever you like).

;; The sorting order of the articles in the summary buffer created by
;; nnir is based on the order of the articles in the above mentioned
;; vector, so that's where you can do the sorting you'd like.  Maybe
;; it would be nice to have a way of displaying the search result
;; sorted differently?

;; So what do you need to do when you want to add another search
;; engine?  You write a function that executes the query.  Temporary
;; data from the search engine can be put in `nnir-tmp-buffer'.  This
;; function should return the list of articles as a vector, as
;; described above.  Then, you need to register this backend in
;; `nnir-engines'.  Then, users can choose the backend by setting
;; `nnir-search-engine'.

;; Todo, or future ideas:

;; * It should be possible to restrict search to certain groups.
;;
;; * There is currently no error checking.
;;
;; * The summary buffer display is currently really ugly, with all the
;;   added information in the subjects.  How could I make this
;;   prettier?
;;
;; * A function which can be called from an nnir summary buffer which
;;   teleports you into the group the current article came from and
;;   shows you the whole thread this article is part of.
;;   Implementation suggestions?
;;   (1998-07-24: There is now a preliminary implementation, but
;;   it is much too slow and quite fragile.)
;;
;; * Support other mail backends.  In particular, probably quite a few
;;   people use nnfolder.  How would one go about searching nnfolders
;;   and producing the right data needed?  The group name and the RSV
;;   are simple, but what about the article number?
;;   - The article number is encoded in the `X-Gnus-Article-Number'
;;     header of each mail.
;;   - The HyREX engine supports nnfolder.
;;
;; * Support compressed mail files.  Probably, just stripping off the
;;   `.gz' or `.Z' file name extension is sufficient.
;;
;; * At least for imap, the query is performed twice.
;;

;; Have you got other ideas?

the following features (inspired by the Google search input language):

Automatic \"and\" queries
    If you specify multiple words then they will be treated as an \"and\"
    expression intended to match all components.

Phrase searches
    If you wrap your query in double-quotes then it will be treated as a
    literal string.

Negative terms
    If you precede a term with \"-\" then it will negate that.

\"OR\" queries
    If you include an upper-case \"OR\" in your search it will cause the
    term before it and the term after it to be treated as alternatives.

In future the following will be added to the language:
 * support for date matches
 * support for location of text matching within the query
 * from/to/etc headers
 * additional search terms
 * flag based searching
 * anything else that the RFC supports, basically."
