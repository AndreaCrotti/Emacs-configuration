;;; Commentary:

;; Time values come in three formats.  The oldest format is a cons
;; cell of the form (HIGH . LOW).  This format is obsolete, but still
;; supported.  The two other formats are the lists (HIGH LOW) and
;; (HIGH LOW MICRO).  The first two formats specify HIGH * 2^16 + LOW
;; seconds; the third format specifies HIGH * 2^16 + LOW + MICRO /
;; 1000000 seconds.  We should have 0 <= MICRO < 1000000 and 0 <= LOW
;; < 2^16.  If the time value represents a point in time, then HIGH is
;; nonnegative.  If the time value is a time difference, then HIGH can
;; be negative as well.  The macro `with-decoded-time-value' and the
;; function `encode-time-value' make it easier to deal with these
;; three formats.  See `time-subtract' for an example of how to use
;; them.

;; Only necessary for `declare' when compiling Gnus with Emacs 21.
