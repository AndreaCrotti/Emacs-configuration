;;; Commentary:

;;; This was based upon Kai Grossjohan's shamessly snarfed code and
;;; further modified by Joe Hildebrand.  It has been updated for Red
;;; Gnus.

;; TODO:
;;
;; * Fix bug where server connection can be lost and impossible to regain
;;   This hasn't happened to me in a while; think it was fixed in Rgnus
;;
;; * make it handle different nndb servers seemlessly
;;
;; * Optimize expire if FORCE
;;
;; * Optimize move (only expire once)
;;
;; * Deal with add/deletion of groups
;;
;; * make the backend TOUCH an article when marked as expireable (will
;;   make article expire 'expiry' days after that moment).
