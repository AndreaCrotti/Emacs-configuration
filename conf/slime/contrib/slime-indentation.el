;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

;; USAGE:

;; This file delivers highly configurable indentation of Lisp code.
;; Eval (cl-indent) to use this indentation for a specific file,
;; (setq lisp-indent-function 'cl-indent:function) to use it for all
;; Lisp files.

;; The indentation for a specific form may be defined by
;; (define-cl-indent SPEC &optional MODE-METHODS). Indentation specs
;; for Common Lisp constructs are given already. Check the on-line
;; documentation of this function for more information.

;; Actually, the whole (`real') documentation of this source is stored
;; as the documentation strings of respective functions. Start with
;; #'define-cl-indent, you'll find references to all other relevant
;; functions.

;; It's also possible to specify specific indentations for a mode
;; (e.g., some special Lisp-mode) and even specific ones for a file.
;; File specific indentations are taken from the alist bound to
;; cl-indent:local-methods, you can set it in your `Local Variables'
;; section. Mode-specific methods are stored in hash tables, the mode
;; setup must bind cl-indent:mode-methods to the name of that hash
;; table.

;; You may want to override my global indentation specs. If you load
;; this file immediately, just issue some #'define-cl-indent calls. If
;; you use autoload, add an appropriate hook function to
;; 'cl-indent:load-hook.

;; I'm interested in feedback on this module. Do you use it, was it
;; useful to you? (Further development depends on the amount of people
;; who send feedback. :-)
;; Send email to <jschrod@acm.org>.



;; ------------------------------------------------------------

;;>> TODO

;; Urgently need better user documentation, it's hard to get a grasp
;; for the overall strategy how this package may be customized. One
;; has to look at too many function documentation strings.

;; Have to check if the usage of hash tables makes this package XEmacs
;; specific. If FSF Emacs doesn't have them, they might be emulated by
;; alists or obarrays. (I don't have FSF Emacs available, may somebody
;; please check this, maybe even send patches?)

;; Realize `parent method tables', to be able to inherit an indentation
;; method table. `(make-method-table &optional size parent)' ?! That's
;; needed before the CL specific indentation is moved to an own table,
;; as some modes (e.g., stil-mode) may inherit their indentation from
;; CL definitions.

;; Common Lisp specific indentation methods should be moved to a
;; method table, it's not good to have them globally for all kinds of
;; Lisp modes. How about a table for Elisp indentations as well?

;; special handling of keywords in forms, e.g.,
;;
;; :foo
;;   bar
;; :baz
;;   zap
;;
;; &key (like &body)??

;; &rest 1 in lambda-lists doesn't work, really want
;;
;;     (foo bar
;;      baz)
;;
;; not
;;
;;     (foo bar
;;          baz)
;;
;; Need something better than &rest for such cases. Perhaps a function
;; that just returns normal-point? Might work...

(defun cl-indent:function (indent-point state)
  "Compute the indentation of the current line of Common Lisp code.
INDENT-POINT is the current point. STATE is the result of a
#'parse-partial-sexp from the start of the current function to the
start of the line this function was called.

The indentation is determined by the expressions point is in.

When this function is called, the column of point may be used as the
normal indentation. Therefore we call this position _normal
point_. Actually, if the first element of the current expression is a
list, it's at the start of this element. Otherwise it's at the start
of first expression on the same line as the last complete expression.

Within a quoted list or a non-form list, all subsequent lines are
indented to the column directly after the opening parenthesis. Quoted
lists are those that are prefixed with ?\`, ?\', or ?\#. Note that the
quote must be immediately in front of the opening parenthesis. I.e.,
if you want to use automatic code indentation in a macro expansion
formulated with a backquoted list, add a blank between the backquote
and the expansion form.

Within a list form, the indentation is determined by the indentation
method associated to the form symbol. (See #'cl-indent::method.)

** If the indentation method is nil, the form is assumed to be a
function call, arguments are aligned beneath each other if the first
argument was written behind the function symbol, otherwise they're
aligned below the function symbol.

** If the indentation method is a symbol, a function must be bound to
that symbol that will compute the current indentation. Such a function
is named an _indentation function_ and is called with 5 arguments:

 (1) PATH is a list of numbers, the path from the top-level form to
     the current structural element (the first element is number 0).
     E.g., `foo' has a path of (0 3 1) in `((a b c (d foo) f) g)'.
 (2) STATE is passed.
 (3) INDENT-POINT is passed.
 (4) SEXP-COLUMN is the column where the innermost form starts.
 (5) NORMAL-INDENT is the column of normal point.

** If the indentation method is a list, this list specifies the form
structure and the indentation of each substructure. The possible list
structure and elements are described in #'cl-indent::form-method.

** If the indentation method is the number $n$, the first $n$
arguments are _distinguished arguments_; they are indented by 4
spaces. Further arguments are indented by lisp-body-indent. That's
roughly equivalent to '(4 4 ... &body)' with $n$ 4s.

** Furthermore values as described for #'lisp-indent-function may be
used for upward compatibility."

;;; ======================================================================
;;
;; $ITIlog: cl-indent.el,v $
;; Revision 1.6  1995/09/10  14:13:34  schrod
;;     Add aliassing of indentation methods.
;;     Discard unused variables. Quiet down the byte-compiler. Discard
;; duplicate indentation specs.
;;     `Define-as' specs in #'define-cl-indent uses the mode-specific
;; method table for lookup of the reference symbol's indentation method,
;; if a table was supplied.
;;
;; Revision 1.5  1995/08/14  16:49:05  schrod
;;     Provide 'cl-indent, this module may not be required otherwise.
;;
;; Revision 1.4  1995/07/24  18:16:50  schrod
;;     Did not work due to spurious closing brace.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  1995/01/17  11:13:25  schrod
;;     Add support for mode-specific and local indentation methods. Don't
;; need STIL indentation support any more, that's an own mode now.
;;     Provide a load hook to be able to adapt global indentation methods
;; to personal preferences.
;;     All form symbols are finally checked for global indentation
;; methods bound to 'lisp-indent-function, for upward compatibility to
;; standard Lisp indentation.
;;     Renamed all symbols to start with `cl-indent:'. Private symbols
;; use `::', similar to CL. #'define-cl-indent is an exception, as usual.
;; I hope that the new names are more meaningful, too.
;;     Added some pointers to function documentation to the usage
;; comments at the start. Mentioned additional future projects.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  1994/09/05  17:35:47  schrod
;;     Added documentation to every function.
;;     Added #'cl-indent and #'define-cl-indent as user-level functions.
;;     Renamed all functions from lisp-indent-* to cl-indent-* to avoid
;; name clashes with `normal' lisp-mode indentation. In particular,
;; rename #'lisp-indent-259 (what a ridiculous name to use for a
;; function!) to #'cl-indent-by-method.
;;     Introduced #'cl-indent-normal to compute the normal (default)
;; indentation, since #'current-column does not always deliver the
;; correct result.
;;     Introduced #'get-cl-indent-method to encapsulate the storage of an
;; indentation method. Might want to change this later anyhow, to support
;; mode- and file-specific indentation.
;;     Check for a correct method is in an own function now,
;; #'cl-indent-by-method was large enough already.
;;     #'lisp-indent-do is never called for the first two elements in a
;; path, this test (and the else form) could be discarded.
;;     Add support for more CL constructs (CLOS, CLCS, condition stuff
;;     Define STIL constructs, this should be discarded with the
;; introduction of mode-specific indentation methods.
