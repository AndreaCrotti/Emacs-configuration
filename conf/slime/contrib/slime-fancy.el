;; Add this to your .emacs:

;;   (add-hook 'slime-load-hook (lambda () (require 'slime-fancy)))
;;
;; We load all SLIME contribs that are currently working,
;; and which only "upgrade" the behavior of SLIME in some way.
;; This includes:
;;   * Adding new commands, keybindings, menu items
;;   * Making things clickable that would otherwise be just plain text

(require 'slime-repl)
(slime-repl-init)

;; Better arglist display, can be turned off by customization.
(unless (featurep 'xemacs)
  (require 'slime-autodoc)

;; Adds new commands and installs compound-prefix-completion as
;; default completion command.  Behaves similar to standard Emacs
;; completion, unless dashes are present. --mkoeppe

;; Just adds commands.  (Well, shadows commands in lisp-mode-map)

;; Makes the inspector fancier.  (Once loaded, can't be turned off.)
(require 'slime-fancy-inspector)
(slime-fancy-inspector-init)

;; Just adds the command C-c M-i.  We do not make fuzzy completion the
;; default completion invoked by TAB. --mkoeppe
(require 'slime-fuzzy)
(slime-fuzzy-init)

;; Do not activate slime-highlighting-edits by default, as it's easier
;; to explictly activate it (if a user really wants it) than to explictly
;; deactivate it once it got globally enabled. -TCR.

;; Load slime-presentations even though they seem to be a
;; controversial feature, as they can be easily turned off by
;; customizing swank:*record-repl-results*. --mkoeppe

;;; Do not load slime-presentation-streams, as this is an experimental
;;; feature that installs patches into some Lisps. --mkoeppe

;;; Do not load slime-typeout-frame, as simply loading causes display of a
;;; typeout frame, which cannot be turned off. --mkoeppe
;;(require 'slime-typeout-frame)

;; Just adds commands.

;;; this contrib has to be adapted.
;; Makes M-. work on local definitions, too.

;; Add/Remove a symbol at point from the relevant DEFPACKAGE form
