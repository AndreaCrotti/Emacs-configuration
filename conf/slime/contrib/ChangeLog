2010-02-20  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: Call init function for fancy
	inspector. Necessary due to 2010-02-15.

2010-02-19  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* slime-fuzzy.el (slime-fuzzy-choices-buffer): Make connection buffer-local, otherwise
	`swank:fuzzy-completion-selected' will be sent to the default connection.

2010-02-17  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Fix bugs when *inferior-buffers* doesn't exist.

	* inferior-slime.el (inferior-slime-start-transcript)
	(inferior-slime-stop-transcript): Make sure the buffer exists.

2010-02-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-asdf.el, slime-autodoc.el, slime-c-p-c.el,
	slime-clipboard.el, slime-fancy-inspector.el, slime-fuzzy,el,
	slime-indentation.el, slime-motd.el,
	slime-presentation-streams.el, slime-presentations.el,
	slime-sbcl-exts, slime-snapshot.el, slime-sprof.el:

	Make sure that contrib code does not try to load in swank code
	asynchronously but use `slime-require' instead; also make sure to
	move the `slime-require' into the contribs' init function.

2010-01-31  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* slime-repl.el (slime-repl-mode): Don't do
	 (use-local-map slime-repl-mode-map) because it will be used
	through slime-repl-map-mode minor mode.
	This fixes double entries in the menu bar.
	Reported by RaceCondition from #lisp.

2010-01-25  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* slime-package-fu.el (slime-goto-next-export-clause): Use

	didn't work in some cases.
	(slime-repl-map-mode): New minor mode which sole purpose is to
	enable `slime-repl-mode-map'.
	(slime-repl-mode): Enable `slime-repl-map-mode' after enabling
	`slime-editing-map'.
	This will finally allow `slime-repl-mode-map' to take precedence of
	`slime-editing-map'.

2010-01-14  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* slime-repl.el (slime-repl-mode-map): Use both
	`slime-editing-map' and `lisp-mode-map' as parent keymaps.
	(slime-repl-mode): Don't use `slime-editing-mode' because
	its keymap is already used above.
	That way `slime-repl-mode-map' takes precedence of
	`slime-editing-map'.

2010-01-08  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* swank-asdf.lisp: Doing list-all-systems-in-central-registry
	might be quite slow since it accesses a file-system,
	so run it once at the background to initialize fs caches.

2010-01-06  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (interesting-variable-p): Exclude keywords

	recurse only if the form, to be recursed into, is a cons.

	Reported by Johannes Gr√∏dem.

2010-01-06  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	system's files.

	instead of switching directly.

2010-01-03  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-autodoc.el (slime-autodoc-mode): Only display
	"enabled"/"disabled" message if called interactively.

2010-01-03  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-autodoc.el (slime-autodoc): Renamed from
	`slime-compute-autodoc'; now also interactive.

	(slime-autodoc-maybe-enable): Adapted accordingly.

2010-01-03  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* slime-repl.el (sldb-insert-frame-call-to-repl): New function
	for inserting a call to a frame into the REPL. Bound to C-y in SLDB.

	* swank-arglists.lisp (arglist-index): Return NIL if more
	arguments were provided than are allowed.
	(form-path-to-arglist-path): Adapted accordingly.

	* slime-autodoc.el (autodoc.1 [test]): Add relevant test cases.

2010-01-03  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-indentation-fu.el, swank-indentation-fu.lisp: Delete
	contrib. Never worked quite right, and the necessary
	infrastructure has since been gone.

2010-01-03  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* swank-asdf.lisp (asdf-system-loaded-p): Don't return a
	generalized boolean, because numbers may be too large for Emacs.

2009-12-30  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (complete-form [test]): Set
	`slime-buffer-package' after changing to lisp-mode because
	changing major-mode kills buffer-local variables.

2009-12-30  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (extract-cursor-marker): Fix typo.
	(autodoc): Do not try to display variable content for T and NIL.
	(interesting-variable-p): New helper.

2009-12-29  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	We must return nil to decline.

2009-12-29  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	More cleanup.

	The RP swank:arglist-for-echo-area is now called swank:autodoc.

	* swank-arglists.lisp (autodoc): Renamed from

	* swank-arglists.lisp (delete-given-args): Make sure to properly
	delete provided-args.

	moment.

	Commands to save&restore image files without disconnecting.

	* slime-snapshot.el: New file.
	* swank-snapshot.lisp: New file.

2009-12-21  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (completions-for-keyword): Return nil
	instead of :not-available because the function is supposed to
	return a list of available completions.

	Adapted from patch by Ariel Badichi.

2009-12-21  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Today's cleanup day.

	(slime-ensure-list)
	(slime-beginning-of-string)
	(slime-check-enclosing-form-specs)

	Deleted. Used old infrastructure.

2009-12-21  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-asdf.lisp (asdf:operation-done-p): ASDF included with some
	implementations doesn't have AROUND method combination, so guard
	against its usage. This will prevent swank:reload-system from working,
	but it will let load swank-asdf.
	Reported by Mark Evenson.

2009-12-19  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-query-replace-system-and-dependents):
	Renamed from `slime-query-replace-system-and-dependencies' because
	that's what it actually does.

2009-12-18  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Add 'M-x slime-query-replace-system-and-dependencies' which is
	like `slime-query-replace-system' but also runs query-replace on
	all files of systems _depending on_ the user-queried system.

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-read-query-replace-args): Factored out from
	`slime-query-replace-system'.
	(slime-query-replace-system): Use it.

2009-12-17  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-asdf.lisp (who-depends-on): Make defslimefun.
	(xref-doit [:depends-on]): New method to make :depends-on valid

	* swank-asdf.lisp (who-depends-on): Add.

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-reload-system): New command for reloading
	a system without recompiling recursively its dependencies.
	REPL shortcut for it is `reload-system'.

	* swank-asdf.lisp (reload-system): New function.

2009-12-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Take recursiveness of LABELS into account for displaying local
	arglists. I.e. make the following work:

         (labels ((iseven (x)
                    ...)
                  (isodd (y)
                    (if (zerop y)
                       nil
                      (iseven <>))))) ; Point is here
	   ...)

	As we only have information to look backward, we cannot show
	arglist for ISODD within ISEVEN, though.

	* swank-arglists.lisp (extract-local-op-arglists): Handle LABELS
	specially.
	(find-subform-with-arglists): Adapted accordingly. Plus: Small
	refactoring, and fix comparasion of local ops to properly deal

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-reify-old-output): Revert change
	of 2009-12-11, which introduced spurious quotes in non-evaluated
	contexts like here:

	  '(1 2 #<STANDARD-CLASS STANDARD-OBJECT> 3 4)

	Presentations do not change standard quoting rules; users just
	need to remember this.

2009-12-11  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* slime-fuzzy.el (slime-fuzzy-choices-buffer): Don't
	show cursor in *Fuzzy Completions*.

2009-12-11  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	presentation) is not tried to be evaluated.
	(slime-copy-presentation-to-repl): Use `looking-back' for looking back.
	Apply De Morgan's law to conditions.
	Patch by Tobias C. Rittweiler.

	* swank-asdf.lisp (find-operation): New function for
	finding asdf operations independent of readtable
	case sensitivity (read Allegro Modern Mode).

	operation-name, and use the above function.

	* slime-asdf.el: Replace strings with operation names
	for `slime-oos' with symbols.

2009-12-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (*swank-debug-arglists*): Removed.

	* swank-arglists.lisp (find-subform-with-arglist): Return
	 (values nil :not-available), not just NIL, when operator is
	`quote' or `function'.
	Fixes bug reported by Mark Harig.

	http://common-lisp.net/project/hyperdoc/

	* slime-hyperdoc.el, swank-hyperdoc.lisp: New contrib.

	(arglist-dispatch [eql 'declare]): First try to lookup arglist of
	a typespec if it's a type-declaration, if not default to looking
	up arglist of declaration specifier.
	(arglist-for-type-declaration): Extracted out.
	(decoded-arglist-for-type-specifier): Make sure not to call
	TYPE-SPECIFIER-ARGLIST with an ARGLIST-DUMMY.

2009-12-03  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-query-replace-regexp): Quote `from'
	argument because `tags-query-replace' actually uses
	`query-replace-regexp' internally.

	Reported by David O'Toole.

2009-12-01  Stas Boukarev  <stassats@gmail.com>

	* swank-asdf.lisp (asdf-system-files): Include the .asd file too.

2009-11-30  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	(slime-repl-mode): ... enable slime-editing-mode.

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-presentation-init-keymaps):
	Replace slime-define-both-key-bindings with slime-bind-keys.
	(slime-presentation-init-keymaps): Use slime-init-keymap.

2009-11-24  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Fix a few edge cases in new arglist code.

	* slime-parse.el (slime-parse-form-upto-point): Regard

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-rgrep-system): Conditionalize on whether
	`rgrep' is available (it isn't on Emacs 21.) Also make sure to
	call `grep-compute-defaults' before `grep-read-regexp' because the
	former does some necessary setup. (Seems to be of a problem on
	Emacs from CVS.)

2009-11-23  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-repl.el (slime-repl-previous-matching-input)
	(slime-repl-next-matching-input): Read input by means of
	`slime-read-from-minibuffer' so TAB will complete symbols for us.

2009-11-23  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-asdf.lisp (operate-on-system-for-emacs),
	(operate-on-system): Muffle ASDF:COMPILE-ERROR because we reuse
	Slime's compilation error reportery anyway, and sldb popping up is
	just annoying.

2009-11-23  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-asdf.lisp (system-contains-file-p): Previous definition
	didn't properly propagate positive return value of recursive
	call. Fix that.

	* slime-repl.el (slime-repl-history-remove-duplicates): New variable,

	(slime-compare-char-syntax): Byte-compile.

	parameter `exclude-string'.
	(slime-repl-history-replace): Don't replace history item if it's exactly

	(slime-maybe-M-.-presentation-at-point): Renamed to
	`slime-edit-presentation'. Now makes sure to decline if user gave
	a name explicitly. 

2008-03-24  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-kawa.scm: Save stacktraces with locals on throw events.
	This is quite costly but makes debugging easier.

2008-03-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (add-slots-for-inspector): Remove
	IGNORE declaration of non-existing argument.

2008-03-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp (fuzzy-convert-matching-for-emacs): Return a
	string representation of the classifications rather than the
	classifications themselves. (Notice this propagates up to (and
	consequently changes the return value of) the RPC function
	FUZZY-COMPLETIONS. (incompatible api change.)  

	Rationale: The number of supported classification can be changed
	without having to adapt its display at the client.

	* slime-fuzzy.lisp (slime-fuzzy-insert-completion-choice):
	(slime-fuzzy-fill-completions-buffer): Adapted to API change.

2008-03-14  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (make-symbols-listing :classification):
	Add support for typespec and constant classification; don't
	silently ignore symbols that can't be usefully classified, but
	group them under "MISC".

2008-03-14  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move filename translation code to contrib.

	* slime-tramp.el (slime-find-filename-translators)
	(slime-filename-translations): Move from slime.el.
	(slime-tramp-from-lisp-filename, slime-tramp-to-lisp-filename):
	New functions.

2008-03-08  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Don't blindly override the inspect method for functions.

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (emacs-inspect function): Define this
	method only if the backend hasn't defined one.
	(inspect-function): New function.

2008-03-02  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-mit-scheme.scm: New file.

2008-02-21  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Having the `slime-presentations' contrib enabled, (princ 10)
	resulted in "1010" rather than "10\n10". (This also caused a
	regression in the `repl-test' test case.)
	
	* swank-presentations.lisp (present-repl-results): Emit fresh-line
	as the original SEND-REPL-RESULTS-TO-EMACS does.

2008-02-18  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Update Kawa backend to the changed inspector protocol.

	* swank-kawa.scm (inspect-object): Return a list (content len
	start end).

	a connected-hook.

2008-02-13  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Track tree-widget change: :dynarg is now called :expander.

	* slime-xref-browser.el (slime-expand-class-node)
	(slime-browse-classes, slime-expand-xrefs, slime-browse-xrefs):
	:dynargs is obsolete, it is now called :expander.

	Fix some bugs introduced by the recent reorganization.

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (emacs-inspect pathname): Fix it
	again.

	* slime-fancy-inspector.el: Use slime-require.

	* slime-fancy.el: slime-fancy-inspector-init no longer exists, so
	don't call it.  Once loaded, it's also no longer possible to turn
	the fancy inspector off.

2008-02-04  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (presenting-object-1): Add
	declare special *record-repl-results* to silence compiler
	warnings.

	* swank-arglists.lisp (arglist-dispatch): Specialize operator-type
	so openmcl doesn't warn about unused arguments.
	(arglist-dispatch): add declare ignore form.

2008-02-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move some functions to swank-arglist.lisp.

	* swank-arglist.lisp (length=, ensure-list, recursively-empty-p)
	(maybecall, exactly-one-p, read-softly-from-string)

	slime.

	* slime-indentation.el: Integrate cl-indent.el into slime's
	contrib infrastructure. Fix bug in &rest.

	* swank-indentation.lisp: Allow an application runnig under slime
	to update emacs' indentation notes.

2008-01-27  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Make autodoc use the correct width of the typeout-window.

	* swank-goo.goo: New file.
	* swank-kawa.scm: New file.

2008-01-11  Stelian Ionescu <sionescu@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-presentations.el
	(slime-copy-or-inspect-presentation-at-mouse): Call
	slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse-to-repl rather than

2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-editing-commands.el (slime-close-all-parens-in-sexp): Use
	new portability function `slime-delete-and-extract-region'.
	
2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-parse.lisp (slime-incomplete-form-at-point): Hopefully
	better fix than before.
	
2008-01-10  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Add keyboard commands (starting with C-c C-v) and a top-level menu
	for presentation-related commands.  Add a command (C-c C-v M-o) to
	forget all objects associated with presentations, without
	clearing the REPL buffer.
	
	* slime-presentations.el
	(slime-presentation-around-or-before-point-or-error): New
	function.
	(slime-inspect-presentation): New function, factored out from

	(slime-copy-presentation-to-repl): New function, factored out
	from slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse.
	(slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse-to-repl): Renamed from
	slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse; use the new function
	slime-copy-presentation-to-repl. 
	(slime-copy-presentation-at-point-to-repl): New command.
	(slime-copy-presentation-to-kill-ring): New function, factored
	out from slime-copy-presentation-at-mouse-to-kill-ring.
	(slime-copy-presentation-at-point-to-kill-ring): New command.

	and slime-presentation-add-easy-menu.

2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-parse.lisp (slime-incomplete-form-at-point): Take the
	arglist index the user's point is located at correctly into
	account. Previously `C-c C-s' on `(defun |foo' would have inserted
        `args body...)', now it inserts `name args body...)'
	
2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (read-form-spec): Changed "cons" clause to
	"list" clause in etypecase. Fix for error on arglist display on
	`(declare (ftype (|)))', | being point.
	
2008-01-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-fuzzy.el (slime-fuzzy-completion-time-limit-in-msec):
	Update docstring: Its value isn't rounded to nearest second, but
	is really interpreted as msecs.

	* swank-fuzzy.el: Updated some comments.
	(fuzzy-generate-matchings): Sort package matchings before
	traversal, such that they're traversed in the order of their
	score. (Important when time limit exhausts during traversal.)
	
2008-01-09  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Restore support for Scheme programs that was removed from core
	SLIME on 2007-09-19, as a "slime-scheme" contrib.
	
	* slime-scheme.el: New file.

2007-12-30  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp: Fix for `(cerror "FOO" 'type-error ...)'

	(*arglist-dummy*): Removed.
	(arglist-dummy): New structure. Wrapper around whatever could not
	be reliably read. The clue is that its printing function does only
	print the object this structure contains.
	(read-conversatively-for-autodoc): Return such a structure if
	conversative reading fails.

2007-11-27  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (arglist-dispatch 'defmethod): Use
	VALID-FUNCTION-NAME-P. Fixes error on certain `(defmethod (setf	...))'
	forms.
	
2007-11-27  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglists.lisp (print-arglist): Print initforms in &optional and
	&key lambda list specifiers as if by PRIN1 instead of PRINC.
	Reported by Michael Weber.
	
2007-11-24  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-fuzzy.el: Use slime-require instead of a connected-hook.

2007-11-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (inspect-for-emacs function t): Don't
	specialize the second argument, so that backend methods take
	precedence.  Reported by Maciej Katafiasz.

2007-10-24  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (decode-arglist): Fix incompatibility with
	ACL's modern reader mode. Thanks to Andreas Fuchs for stumbling
	over this.

2007-10-22  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (read-softly): Renamed to
	READ-SOFTLY-FROM-STRING and moved to `swank.lisp'.
	(unintern-in-home-package): Moved to `swank.lisp'.

2007-10-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-autdoc.el (slime-autodoc-message-ok-p): Don't display an
	arglist when the minibuffer is active.

2007-10-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el: Messages in the typeout frame were too
	easily overwritten by `slime-autodoc'. Fix that.
	Reported by Geoff Wozniak.
	
	(slime-typeout-message-aux): Split out from `slime-typeout-message'.
	(slime-typeout-message): Wrapper around it. Additionally disable
	the autodoc timer temporarily.

2007-09-30  Geoff Wozniak  <geoff@wozniak.ca>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el (slime-typeout-frame-init): Fix quoted
	FUNCTION forms in literal.

2007-09-28  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* README: Updated.

	* slime-fancy.el: `slime-highlighting-edits' is not enabled by
	default anymore, as its functionality is controversial, and it's
	easier to explicitly enable it than to disable it once it got
	globally activated. Better to be conservative.

	* slime-fancy.el: Not only load, but also enable `slime-scratch'.

2007-09-21  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-asdf.el (slime-asdf-init, slime-asdf-unload): Fix typos.
	Reported by Ariel Badichi.

2007-09-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Separate loading from initialization for many contribs.

	* slime-asdf.el
	* slime-autodoc.el
	* slime-banner.el
	* slime-c-p-c.el
	* slime-editing-commands.el
	* slime-fancy-inspector.el
	* slime-fuzzy.el
	* slime-highlight-edits.el
	* slime-presentations.el
	* slime-references.el
	* slime-scratch.el
	* slime-typeout-frame.el
	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp

	* slime-fancy.el: As an exception, call the respective init
	function when loading.

2007-09-19  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-complete-symbol*-fancy): Move defcustom
	from slime.el to contrib/slime-c-p-c.el.

2007-09-16  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp: Fix regression that would not allow to fuzzy
	complete on inputs without package qualifier like "app".
	Reported by David J. Neu.
	
	(%make-duplicate-symbols-filter): Return complement.
	(fuzzy-find-matching-symbols): Treat passed filter as an acceptor
	predicate, not as a rejector.
	
2007-09-15  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Add the necessary hooks when loading some contribs, so that those
	contribs can be easily loaded with slime-setup.

	* slime-highlight-edits.el (slime-highlight-edits-mode-on): New
	function.  Add this to slime-mode-hook by default.

	* slime-autodoc.el (slime-use-autodoc-mode): Change default to t.

2007-09-15  Ariel Badichi <abadichi@bezeqint.net>

	* swank-fancy-inspector.lisp (inspect-for-emacs package): When
        inspecting a package, the links in the use list and the used-by
        list lead to inspecting package names, rather than the packages
        themselves. Fix that.

2007-09-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el: Fix extended arglist display on misbalanced
	expressions like `(defun foo | ... (defun bar () 'bar)'
	Reported by Ariel Badichi.
	
	(slime-inside-string-p): Use `beginning-of-defun' directly than
	relying on `slime-region-for-defun-at-point' (as this one uses
	`end-of-defun' which signals an error on misbalanced expressions.)

2007-09-15  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-fuzzy.lisp: Code reorganization and cleanup; making it
	compute less and couple of other minor issues fixed on the
	way. Thanks to Stelian Ionescu for testing and providing feedback!

	(defstruct fuzzy-matching): New `package-name' slot.
	(make-fuzzy-matching): Updated for new slot.
	(format-completion-result): Renamed to `fuzzy-format-matching'.
	(%fuzzy-extract-matching-info): Helper for `fuzzy-format-matching'.

	(fuzzy-completion-set): Convert the matchings after they got
	truncated to the passed completion-set limit from Emacs.
	I.e. `slime-fuzzy-completion-limit' This means a huge
	computational reduction.

	(fuzzy-create-completion-set): Renamed to `fuzzy-generate-matchings'.
	(fuzzy-generate-matchings): Returns the fuzzy matchings
	themselves, do not yet convert them for Emacs. Do not perform two
	sorts on the generated matchings (first alphabetically, then per
	score), but just one with an appropriate predicate that sorts per
	score, unless matchings are equal, then sort alphabetically. Prune
	matchings with symbols which are found in a differenta package
	than their home package when the home package is among the matched
	packages. Try to take the time needed to sort the generated
	matchings into account for the time-limit.
	(%guess-sort-duration): Helper. 
	Tries to guess how long the sort will take.
	(%make-duplicate-symbols-filter): Helper. 
	Used for pruning of matchings.
	(fuzzy-matching-greaterp): New testing predicate for sorting.

	(fuzzy-find-matching-symbols): Now takes a :filter keyarg; only
	considers symbols that pass through the filter.
	(fuzzy-find-matching-packages): Do not return matchings for all
	nicknames of package, but just the one that matches best.	
	
2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-editing-commands.el: Automatically bind the editing
	commands when this module is required. (Previously, one had to
	enable them explicitly, but this is inconsistent to, for instance,
	the `slime-c-p-c' module which also sets up its bindings
	automatically.)
	(slime-bind-editing-commands): Renamed to `slime-editing-commands-init'.
	(slime-editing-commands-init): Evaluated at toplevel.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-enclosing-form-specs): Now also works even
	when point is inside a string.
	(slime-inside-string-p): New function.
	(slime-beginning-of-string): New function.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp (read-conversatively-for-autodoc): Also parse
	quoted symbols explicitly. This fixed extended arglist display for
	`(make-instance 'foo'. Reported by: Johannes Groedem.

2007-09-11  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: Require `slime-references'.
	
2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-cl-symbol-name, slime-cl-symbol-package):
	Move from slime.el to contrib/slime-parse.el.

2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* inferior-slime.el: Fix installation comment.

2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Fix some of the bugs introduced with the last change.
	
	* slime-references.el (sldb-reference-face): Add missing quote.
	(sldb-reference-properties): We are lucky and can use keywords
	instead of strings.
	(sldb-maybe-insert-references): Insert newlines differently.
	
2007-09-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	Move SBCL doc references to contrib.

	* slime-references.el: New file.

2007-09-10  Attila Lendvai  <attila.lendvai@gmail.com>

	* slime-fuzzy.el: Fixed some race condition that prevented a
	proper closing of the *Fuzzy Completions* buffer in some
	circumstances.
	
	(slime-fuzzy-save-window-configuration): Removed. Hooking up
	`window-configuration-change-hook' via `run-with-timer' was racy
	and lead to this bug; we now set the hook explicitely at the
	necessary place instead.
	(slime-fuzzy-window-configuration-change-add-hook): Removed.
	(slime-fuzzy-choices-buffer): Explicitly save the
	window-configuration, and explicitly set the hook.
	(slime-fuzzy-done): Explicitely remove the hook.

2007-09-10  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-parse.el (slime-cl-symbol-name, slime-cl-symbol-package):
	Moved back into slime.el.

2007-09-08  Stelian Ionescu  <sionescu@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-banner.el: Fixed typo to provide `slime-banner', not
	`slime-startup-animation'.

2007-09-06  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-presentation-write): Use case, not
	ecase, for dispatching targets.  Should fix XEmacs compatibility.
	Reported by Steven E. Harris.

2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-c-p-c.el: This file incorrectly provided the module
	`:swank-compound-prefix'; changed that to `:swank-c-p-c'. 

	This gets rid off the nasty redefinition warnings that were
	previously signalled when loading SWANK with SBCL.

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-for-echo-area): Locally declare
	`*arglist-pprint-bindings*' to be special, as the variable is
	defined later in the file. (Gets rid of warnings during loading.)

2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* slime-c-p-c.el (slime-c-p-c-init): Bind `slime-complete-form' to
	`C-c C-s' in `slime-repl-mode-map'.
	
2007-09-05  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for DECLAIM and PROCLAIM.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-extended-operator-name-parser-alist): Added
	entries for "DECLAIM", and "PROCLAIM".
	(slime-parse-extended-operator/declare): Provide information about
	the operator the arglist is requested for.
	(slime-make-form-spec-from-string): Fixed for "()" as input.
	
	* swank-arglists.lisp (valid-operator-symbol-p): Explicitly allow
	the symbol 'DECLARE.
	(arglist-dispatch): New method for `DECLARE'. We have to catch
	this explicitly, as DECLARE doesn't have an arglist (in the
	`swank-backend:arglist' sense.)
	(*arglist-pprint-bindings*): New variable. Splitted out from
	`decoded-arglist-to-string'.
	(decoded-arglist-to-string): Use `*arglist-pprint-bindings*'.

	(parse-first-valid-form-spec): Rewritten, because function
	signature had to be changed: doesn't take arg-indices anymore;
	returns position of first valid spec as second value to remedy.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Accomodated to new signature of
	`parse-first-valid-form-spec'; now searchs for contextual
	declaration operator name, to prefix a declaration arglist by
	"declare", "declaim", or "proclaim" depending on what was used at
	user's point in Slime. Use `*arglist-pprint-bindings*' for
	printing the found declaration operator name.
	(%find-declaration-operator): New helper to do this search.
	(completions-for-keyword): Accomodated to new signature of
	`parse-first-valid-form-spec'. Also fixed to correctly provide
	keyword completions in nested expressions like:

	   `(defun foo (x)
	      (let ((bar 'quux))
	        (with-open-file (s f :|'    [`|' being point]

	Move asdf support to contrib:

	* slime-asdf.el: New file.

	* swank-asdf.lisp: New file
	(operate-on-system, asdf-central-registry)
	(list-all-systems-known-to-asdf): Use the asdf package in the
	source code, i.e. write asdf:operate instead of
	 (find-symbol "OPERATE" "ASDF").

2007-09-04  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime-tramp.el: New file.
	* slime-banner.el: New file.
	* inferior-slime.el: New file.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-fancy.el: New meta-contrib.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-presentations.el (slime-dispatch-presentation-event):
	Explicitly return t to indicate the events have been handled,
	rather than relying on the return values of the called functions.

2007-09-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime-typeout-frame.el (slime-typeout-autodoc-message): Fix for
	messages that contain "%".  Reported by Martin Simmons.

2007-09-01  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Makes `slime-complete-form' work on `(eval-when |'; doesn't work
	on `(eval-when (|' yet.
	
	* slime-parse.el (slime-parse-sexp-at-point): Guard against
	`(char-after)' being NIL at end of buffer (especially important
	for use on the REPL.)

	* swank-arglist.lisp (arglist-dispatch 'eval-when): Fix typo.
	(print-decoded-arglist-as-template): Print keywords with PRIN1.
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	Added extended arglist display for EVAL-WHEN, viz:

	  (eval-when (&any :compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) &body body)

	Notice that completion works as expected on these keywords.

	Die, EVAL-ALWAYS, die!

	* swank-arglist (arglist-dispatch): New method for EVAL-WHEN.
	(print-arglist): Print keywords with PRIN1 rather than PRINC,
	to get a result as shown above for the EVAL-WHEN case.
	(completions-for-keyword): Add support for &ANY args.	 
	
2007-08-31  Tobias C. Rittweiler  <tcr@freebits.de>

	* swank-arglist.lisp: Do not fall back to READ when interpreting
	the ``raw form specs'' comming from Slime's autodoc stuff. But
	still do so for those comming from `slime-complete-form'.

	(unintern-in-home-package): New.

	(*arglist-dummy*): New.
	(read-conversatively-for-autodoc): New function. Doesn't READ
	anything that comes from Slime's autodoc. Just tries to parse
	symbols. If that's not successfull, returns the dummy placeholder
	datum stored in `*arglist-dummy*'.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Parse form-specs using
	`read-conversatively-for-autodoc'. Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	(read-softly): New. Splitted out from `read-form-spec'. This
	function tries to keep track of newly interned functions before
	READing.
	(read-form-spec): Parametrized to take a function to read the
	elements of the passed ``raw form spec''. Uses `read-softly' as
	default reader.

	(complete-form, completions-for-keywords): 
	Use `unintern-in-home-package'.

	(slime-output-target-to-marker, slime-output-target-marker)
	(slime-redirect-trace-output): Moved back into SLIME core.

	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp: Require swank-presentations.

	function. Add it to slime-repl-clear-buffer-hook.

	* slime-presentations.el: New file.
	* slime-scratch.el (slime-scratch-buffer): Ignore presentations.

	Some fixes to the presentation-streams contrib.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp [sbcl]: Load the pretty-printer
	patch only at load time.  Add some trickery so that SBCL does not
	complain about the changed layout of the pretty-stream class.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p): Using special
	return values, indicate whether we are printing to the
	REPL-results stream, or a dedicated stream.
	(presentation-record): New slot "target".
	(presentation-start, presentation-end): Use it (rather than the
	global variable *use-dedicated-output-stream*) to decide whether
	to use the bridge protocol or the :presentation-start/-end
	protocol.  Also use it as the TARGET argument of
	:presentation-start/-end messages. 
	(presenting-object-1): Use the new return values of
	slime-stream-p.
	
	* swank-presentation-streams.lisp (slime-stream-p) [cmu]: Use the
	return value of slime-stream-p rather than the global variable
	*use-dedicated-output-stream* to decide whether printing through
	pretty streams is safe for the layout.

2007-08-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Make the fancy "presentation streams" feature a contrib.
	Previously, it was only available if "present.lisp" was loaded
	manually. 
	
	* slime-presentation-streams.el: New file.
