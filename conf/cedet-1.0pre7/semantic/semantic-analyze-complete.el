CONTEXT is either a position (such as point), or a precalculated
context.  Passing in a context is useful if the caller also needs
to access parts of the analysis.
Completions run through the following filters:
  * Elements currently in scope
  * Constants currently in scope
  * Elements match the :prefix in the CONTEXT.
  * Type of the completion matches the type of the context.
Context type matching can identify the following:
  * No specific type
  * Assignment into a variable of some type.
  * Argument to a function with type constraints.
When called interactively, displays the list of possible completions
in a buffer."
