;;; Commentary:
;;
;; NOTE: THESE APIs ARE OBSOLETE:
;;
;; Databases of various forms can all be searched.  These routines
;; cover many common forms of searching.
;;
;; There are three types of searches that can be implemented:
;;
;; Basic Search:
;;  These searches allow searching on specific attributes of tags,
;;  such as name or type.
;;
;; Advanced Search:
;;  These are searches that were needed to accomplish some tasks
;;  during in utilities.  Advanced searches include matching methods
;;  defined outside some parent class.
;;
;;  The reason for advanced searches are so that external
;;  repositories such as the Emacs obarray, or java .class files can
;;  quickly answer these needed questions without dumping the entire
;;  symbol list into Emacs for a regular semanticdb search.
;;
;; Generic Search:
;;  The generic search, `semanticdb-find-nonterminal-by-function'
;;  accepts a Emacs Lisp predicate that tests tags in Semantic
;;  format.  Most external searches cannot perform this search.
