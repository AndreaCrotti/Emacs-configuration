;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Manage temporary pulsing of faces and overlays.
;;
;; This is a temporal decoration technique where something is to be
;; highlighted briefly.  This adds a gentle pulsing style to the text
;; decorated this way.
;;
;; Useful user functions:
;;
;; `pulse-enable-integration-advice' - Turn on advice to make various
;;      Emacs commands pulse, such as `goto-line', or `find-tag'.
;;
;; The following are useful entry points:
;;
;; `pulse' - Cause `pulse-highlight-face' to shift toward background color.
;;      Assumes you are using a version of Emacs that supports pulsing.
;;
;;
;; `pulse-momentary-highlight-one-line' - Pulse a single line at POINT.
;; `pulse-momentary-highlight-region' - Pulse a region.
;; `pulse-momentary-highlight-overlay' - Pulse an overlay
;;      These three functions will just blink the specified area if
;;      the version of Emacs you are using doesn't support pulsing.
;;
;; `pulse-line-hook-function' - A simple function that can be used in a
;;      hook that will pulse whatever line the cursor is on.
;;
;;; History:
;;
;; The original pulse code was written for semantic tag highlighting.
;; It has been extracted, and adapted for general purpose pulsing.
;;
;; Pulse is a part of CEDET.  http://cedet.sf.net
