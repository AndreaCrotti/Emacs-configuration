Using CEDET from CVS:
====================

If you have loaded CEDET from CVS, you will find that the basic
installation is almost the same as for the regular distribution.

All EDE Project files for CEDET are checked into CVS along with the
corresponding Makefiles.  Since "Project.ede" comes after "Makefile"
alphabetically, your CVS checkout command will always leave timestamps
that indicates that the Makefiles are out of date.

Thus, the first compilation step is:

-----
touch `find . -name Makefile`
-----

To compile and install the rest of the released versions of CEDET,
please read the INSTALL file.




Web Site:
========

The CEDET CVS repository contains the full source to the CEDET web
page which is usually found on:

http://cedet.sf.net



Unreleased Software:
===================

The CEDET CVS repository sometimes contains new software that has not
been integrated into the CEDET distribution and build system.  This
section describes any such tools.

cedet/srecode
-------------

The SRecode tools stands for "Semantic Recoder".
SRecode is a template library manager for auto-generating code for any
language.  Complex code generation is managed through Semantic
compatible tags.

SRecode has a reasonable manual that will assist you in understanding
what it is for.  To try it out, add this to your .emacs file:

-------
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/cedet/srecode"))
(require 'srecode-load)
--------



Obsolete Software:
=================

The CEDET CVS repository contains some software that has been
obsoleted with time as newer tools come online.

You can still use some of these tools if you want, but the bit-rot
will eventually get you.

cedet/quickpeek
---------------

Quick Peek was an attempt to get eldoc like behavior using only etags
files.  It worked pretty well, but it required a clever parser to
provide smart output.  Eventually I started writing Semantic so I
could have a parser to do this work.  It was later obsoleted by an
eldoc interface, and then the `semantic-idle-scheduler-mode'.
