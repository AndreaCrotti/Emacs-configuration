Changes In EIEIO Version 1.0

  previous versions of EIEIO.

** All inherited :BEFORE and :AFTER implementations are called for
   each method call, with the most specific methods being called
   first.

** You can now call a :STATIC method by passing in an object as well
   as a class.

** accessor methods for :class allocated slots are now :static methods.

* Linemark Changes

** Allow creation of marks in files that are not associated with a file.

** Linemark faces have changed slightly.

*** You can clear bookmarks in bufferes not assocated with files.

* lmcompile.el - new demo program for linemark.
