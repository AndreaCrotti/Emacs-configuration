Changes and New Features in AUCTeX
**********************************

News in 11.85
=============

   * Font locking has been improved significantly.  It is now less
     prone to color bleeding which could lead to high resource usage.
     In addition it now includes information about LaTeX macro syntax
     and can indicate syntactically incorrect macros in LaTeX mode.

   * The license was updated to GPLv3.

   * Support for the nomencl, flashcards and comment LaTeX packages as
     well as the Icelandic language option of babel were added.

   * Support for folding of math macros was added.

   * Lots of minor bugs in features and documentation fixed.

News in 11.84
=============

   * There have been problems with the `-without-texmf-dir' option to
     `configure' when the value of `-with-kpathsea-sep' was set or
     determined for an installation system with a default different
     from that of the runtime system.  `with-kpathsea-sep' has been
     removed; the setting is now usually determined at runtime.

     Due to this and other problems, preview-latex in the released
     XEmacs package failed under Windows or with anything except recent
     21.5 XEmacsen.

   * AUCTeX and preview-latex have been changed in order to accommodate
     file names containing spaces.  preview-latex now tolerates bad
     PostScript code polluting the stack (like some Omega fonts).

   * `preview.sty' had in some cases failed to emit PostScript header
     specials.

   * Support for folding of comments was added.

   * The `polish' language option of the babel LaTeX package as well as
     the polski LaTeX package are now supported.  Most notably this
     means that AUCTeX will help to insert quotation marks as defined
     by polish.sty (`"`..."'') and polski.sty (`,,...''').

   * The TeX tool bar is now available and enabled by default in plain
     TeX mode.

   * Bug fix in the display of math subscripts and superscripts.

   * Bug fix `TeX-doc' for Emacs 21.

   * There has been quite a number of other bug fixes to various
     features and documentation across the board.


News in 11.83
=============

   * The new function `TeX-doc' provides easy access to documentation
     about commands and packages or information related to TeX and
     friends in general.  It is accessible with the key binding `C-c ?'
     or the `Find Documentation...' entry in the mode menus.

   * You can now get rid of generated intermediate and output files by
     means of the new `Clean' and `Clean All' entries in
     `TeX-command-list' accessible with `C-c C-c' or the Command menu.

   * Support for forward search with PDF files was added.  That means
     you can jump to a place in the output file corresponding to the
     position in the source file.  Currently this only works if you use
     the pdfsync LaTeX package and xpdf as your PDF viewer.  The
     accuracy is in the range of +/-1 page.

     Adding support for this feature required the default value of the
     variable `TeX-output-view-style' to be changed.  Please make sure
     you either remove any customizations overriding the new default or
     incorporate the changes into your customizations if you want to
     use this feature.

   * TeX error messages of the `-file-line-error' kind are now
     understood in AUCTeX and preview-latex (parsers are still
     separate).

   * Bug fix in XyMTeX support.

   * The LaTeX tool bar is now enabled by default.


News in 11.82
=============

   * Support for the MinionPro LaTeX package was added.

   * Warnings and underfull/overfull boxes are now being indicated in
     the echo area after a LaTeX run, if the respective debugging
     options are activated with `TeX-toggle-debug-warnings' (`C-c C-t
     C-w') or `TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes' (`C-c C-t C-b').  In this
     case `TeX-next-error' will find these warnings in addition to
     normal errors.

     The key binding `C-c C-w' for `TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes' (which
     was renamed from `TeX-toggle-debug-boxes') now is deprecated.

   * AUCTeX now can automatically insert a pair of braces after typing
     <_> or <^> in math constructs if the new variable
     `TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript' is set to a non-nil value.

   * Some language-specific support for French was added.  There now is
     completion support for the commands provided by the `frenchb' (and
     `francais') options of the babel LaTeX package and easier input of
     French quotation marks (`\\og ...\\fg') which can now be inserted
     by typing <">.

   * Completion support for options of some LaTeX packages was added.

   * Already in version 11.81 the way to activate AUCTeX changed
     substantially.  This should now be done with `(load "auctex.el" nil
     t t)' instead of the former `(require 'tex-site)'.  Related to this
     change `tex-mik.el' does not load `tex-site.el' anymore.  That
     means if you used only `(require 'tex-mik)' in order to activate
     AUCTeX, you have to add `(load "auctex.el" nil t t)' before the
     latter statement.  More detailed information can be found in the
     installation instructions (file INSTALL).

   * Handling of verbatim constructs was consolidated across AUCTeX.
     This resulted in the font-latex-specific variables
     `font-latex-verb-like-commands', `font-latex-verbatim-macros', and
     `font-latex-verbatim-environments' being removed and the more
     general variables `LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims',
     `LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces', and
     `LaTeX-verbatim-environments' being added.

   * The output of a BibTeX run is now checked for warnings and errors,
     which are reported in the echo area.

   * The aliases for `font-latex-title-fontify' were removed.  Use
     `font-latex-fontify-sectioning' instead.

   * The problem that Japanese macros where broken across lines was
     fixed.

   * Various bug fixes.

News in 11.81
=============

   * `LaTeX-mark-section' now marks subsections of a given section as
     well.  The former behavior is available via the prefix argument.

   * preview-latex which was previously available separately became a
     subsystem of AUCTeX.  There is no documented provision for building
     or installing preview-latex separately.  It is still possible to
     use and install AUCTeX without preview-latex, however.

   * The installation procedures have been overhauled and now also
     install startup files as part of the process (those had to be
     copied manually previously).  You are advised to remove previous
     installations of AUCTeX and preview-latex before starting the
     installation procedure.  A standard installation from an
     unmodified tarball no longer requires Makeinfo or Perl.

     Also note that the way AUCTeX is supposed to be activated changed.
     Instead of `(require 'tex-site)' you should now use `(load
     "auctex.el" nil t t)'.  While the former method may still work,
     the new method has the advantage that you can deactivate a
     preactivated AUCTeX with the statement `(unload-feature
     'tex-site)' before any of its modes have been used.  This may be
     important especially for site-wide installations.

   * Support for the babel LaTeX package was added.

   * Folding a buffer now ensures that the whole buffer is fontified
     before the actual folding is carried out.  If this results in
     unbearably long execution times, you can fall back to the old
     behavior of relying on stealth font locking to do this job in the
     background by customizing the variable `TeX-fold-force-fontify'.

   * Folded content now reveals part of its original text in a tooltip
     or the echo area when hovering with the mouse pointer over it.

   * The language-specific insertion of quotation marks was
     generalized.  The variables `LaTeX-german-open-quote',
     `LaTeX-german-close-quote', `LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote',
     `LaTeX-italian-open-quote', `LaTeX-italian-close-quote', and
     `LaTeX-italian-quote-after-quote' are now obsolete.  If you are not
     satisfied with the default settings, you should customize
     `TeX-quote-language-alist' instead.

   * Similar to language-specific quote insertion, AUCTeX now helps you
     with hyphens in different languages as well.

   * Fill problems in Japanese text introduced in AUCTeX 11.55 were
     fixed.  AUCTeX tries not to break lines between 1-byte and 2-byte
     chars.  These features will work in Chinese text, too.

   * The scaling factor of the fontification of sectioning commands can
     now be customized using the variable
     `font-latex-fontify-sectioning'.  This variable was previously
     called `font-latex-title-fontify'; In this release we provide an
     alias but this will disappear in one of the the next releases.
     The faces for the sectioning commands are now called
     `font-latex-sectioning-N-face' (N=0...5) instead of
     `font-latex-title-N-face' (N=1...4).  Analogously the names of the
     variables holding the related keyword lists were changed from
     `font-latex-title-N-keywords' to
     `font-latex-sectioning-N-keywords'.  Make sure to adjust your
     customizations.

   * Titles in beamer slides marked by the "\frametitle" command are
     know displayed with the new face `font-latex-slide-title-face'.
     You can add macros to be highlighted with this face to
     `font-latex-match-slide-title-keywords'.

   * Of course a lot of bugs have been fixed.

News in 11.55
=============

   * A bug was fixed which lead to the insertion of trailing whitespace
     during filling.  In particular extra spaces were added to sentence
     endings at the end of lines.  You can make this whitespace visible
     by setting the variable `show-trailing-whitespace' to `t'.  If you
     want to delete all trailing whitespace in a buffer, type `M-x
     delete-trailing-whitespace RET'.

   * A bug was fixed which lead to a `*Compile-Log*' buffer popping up
     when the first LaTeX file was loaded in an Emacs session.

   * On some systems the presence of an outdated Emacspeak package lead
     to the error message `File mode specification error: (error
     "Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size")'.  Precautions
     were added which prevent this error from happening.  But
     nevertheless, it is advised to upgrade or uninstall the outdated
     Emacspeak package.

   * The value of `TeX-macro-global' is not determined during
     configuration anymore but at load time of AUCTeX.  Consequently the
     associated configuration option `--with-tex-input-dirs' was
     removed.

   * Support for the LaTeX Japanese classes `jsarticle' and `jsbook'
     was added.

News in 11.54
=============

   * The parser (used e.g. for `TeX-auto-generate-global') was extended
     to recognize keywords common in LaTeX packages and classes, like
     "\DeclareRobustCommand" or "\RequirePackage".  Additionally a bug
     was fixed which led to duplicate entries in AUCTeX style files.

   * Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
     constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new `TeX-fold-dwim'
     command content can both be hidden and shown with a single key
     binding.  In course of these changes new key bindings for
     unfolding commands where introduced.  The old bindings are still
     present but will be phased out in future releases.

   * Info files of the manual now have a .info extension.

   * There is an experimental tool bar support now.  It is not
     activated by default.  If you want to use it, add
          (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-install-toolbar)
     to your init file.

   * The manual now contains a new chapter "Quick Start".  It explains
     the main features and how to use them, and should be enough for a
     new user to start using AUCTeX.

   * A new section "Font Locking" was added to the manual which explains
     syntax highlighting in AUCTeX and its customization.  Together with
     the sections related to folding and outlining, the section is part
     of the new chapter "Display".

   * Keywords for syntax highlighting of LaTeX constructs to be typeset
     in bold, italic or typewriter fonts may now be customized.
     Besides the built-in classes, new keyword classes may be added by
     customizing the variable `font-latex-user-keyword-classes'.  The
     customization options can be found in the customization group
     `font-latex-keywords'.

   * Verbatim content is now displayed with the `fixed-pitch' face. (GNU
     Emacs only)

   * Syntax highlighting should not spill out of verbatim content
     anymore. (GNU Emacs only)

   * Verbatim commands like `\verb|...|' will not be broken anymore
     during filling.

   * You can customize the completion for graphic files with
     `LaTeX-includegraphics-read-file'.

   * Support for the LaTeX packages `url', `listings', `jurabib' and
     `csquotes' was added with regard to command completion and syntax
     highlighting.

   * Performance of fontification and filling was improved.

   * Insertion of nodes in Texinfo mode now supports completion of
     existing node names.

   * Setting the variable `LaTeX-float' to `nil' now means that you
     will not be prompted for the float position of figures and tables.
     You can get the old behaviour of `nil' by setting the variable to
     `""', i.e. an empty string.

   * The XEmacs-specific bug concerning `overlays-at' was fixed.

   * Lots of bug fixes.

News in 11.53
=============

   * The LaTeX math menu can include Unicode characters if your Emacs
     built supports it.  See the variable `LaTeX-math-menu-unicode'.

   * Bug fixes for XEmacs.

   * Completion for graphic files in the TeX search path has been added.

   * `start' is used for the viewer for MiKTeX and fpTeX.

   * The variable `TeX-fold-preserve-comments' can now be customized to
     deactivate folding in comments.

News in 11.52
=============

   * Installation and menus under XEmacs work again (maybe for the first
     time).

   * Fontification of subscripts and superscripts is now disabled when
     the fontification engine is not able to support it properly.

   * Bug fixes in the build process.

News in 11.51
=============

   * PDFTeX and Source Special support did not work with ConTeXt, this
     has been fixed.  Similar for Source Special support under Windows.

   * Omega support has been added.

   * Bug fixes in the build process.

   * `TeX-fold' now supports folding of environments in Texinfo mode.

News in 11.50
=============

   * The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document
     can now be controlled with the new `TeX-source-specials' minor mode
     which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key
     binding `C-c C-t C-s'.  If you have customized the variable
     `TeX-command-list', you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
     This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by
     typing `M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET', selecting
     "Erase Customization" and do your customization again with the new
     default.

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     `TeX-command-list' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g. footnotes or
     citations, and environments in a buffer was added.

   * You can now control if indentation is done upon typing <RET> by
     customizing the variable `TeX-newline-function'.

   * Limited support for `doc.sty' and `ltxdoc.cls' (`dtx' files) was
     added.  The new docTeX mode provides functionality for editing
     documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
     filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while
     staying in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note
     that the mode is not finished yet.  For example syntax
     highlighting does not work yet in XEmacs.)

   * For macro completion in docTeX mode the AUCTeX style files
     `doc.el', `ltxdoc.el' and `ltx-base.el' were included.  The latter
     provides general support for low-level LaTeX macros and may be
     used with LaTeX class and style files as well.  It is currently
     not loaded automatically for those files.

   * Support for ConTeXt with a separate ConTeXt mode is now included.
     Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and
     English.

   * The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
     format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
     available functionality and customization options are explained in
     the manual.

   * Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
     previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line
     previews.  AUCTeX now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

   * If `TeX-master' is set to `t', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function `TeX-master-file-ask' (bound to `C-c _'
     is provided for adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display
     devices which support such fontification.  The variable
     `font-latex-title-fontify' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for `alphanum.sty', `beamer.cls', `booktabs.sty',
     `captcont.sty', `emp.sty', `paralist.sty', `subfigure.sty' and
     `units.sty'/`nicefrac.sty' was added.  Credits go to the authors
     mentioned in the respective AUCTeX style files.

   * Inserting graphics with `C-c RET \includegraphics RET' was
     improved.  See the variable `LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist'.

   * If `LaTeX-default-position' is `nil', don't prompt for position
     arguments in Tabular-like environments.

   * Completion for available packages when using `C-c RET \usepackage
     RET' was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

   * The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
     commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for
     paragraphs and regions respectively which do both.

   * Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited
     by either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the
     variable `font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX keywords for functions, references, variables
     and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
     keywords by customizing the variables
     `font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     `font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     `font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files `german' or `ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the `babel' package), you should now customize
     `LaTeX-german-open-quote', `LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     `LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of `TeX-open-quote',
     `TeX-close-quote' and `TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line
     options for it are now determined automatically by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the
     source file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively
     by customizing the variable `TeX-output-view-style'.

   * You can control whether `TeX-insert-macro' (`C-c RET') ask for all
     optional arguments by customizing the variable
     `TeX-insert-macro-default-style'.

   * `TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on `autoconf'
     making installing AUCTeX a mostly automatic process.  See the
     files `INSTALL' and `INSTALL.windows' for details.
