README for the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) version 2.40


About
-----

This package contains a code browser for several programming-languages for
(X)Emacs. For instructions on how to use the browser read the online-help
either with the shipped info-manual (see "Usage" below) or direct from the
ECB-Homepage at http://ecb.sourceforge.net.

The latest version can be found at: http://ecb.sourceforge.net

------------
Requirements
------------

1. Emacs-version: ECB works only with (X)Emacs >= 21! If you have an older
   one, please upgrade.

2. Install CEDET-suite: Get it from http://cedet.sourceforge.net, read
   the setup-instructions in http://cedet.sourceforge.net/setup.shtml and
   read also the shipped file INSTALL.

3. Only for XEmacs-users: If you use XEmacs you must have installed the
   package c-support (contains hideshow.el). If you want to read the
   online-help of ECB in HTML-format you must have the library browse-url
   (part of the mail-lib XEmacs package) installed; this package is also
   needed for submitting problem-reports to the ECB-maintainers!

4. Optional for Java-coding: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when
   the JDEE package ( http://jdee.sourceforge.net) is installed.


Do not install ECB before you have successfully installed the requirements!


------------
Installation
------------

*IMPORTANT*: ECB is no longer runnable as XEmacs-package via the
package-manager of XEmacs. This is because CEDET is not available as
XEmacs-package. Therefore ECB can also not be run as XEmacs-package. If CEDET
will later become a XEmacs-package then probably ECB will come back as
XEmacs-package. But in the meanwhile you have to install ECB "by hand".

  1. Fulfill all requirements ECB needs (*note Requirements::)

     ECB performs two autom checks:

        - At load-time: It checks if the cedet-suite is at least installed so
          ECB can be loaded. If not it reports an error.

        - At start-time: It checks if the correct versions of cedet and
          semantic are installed and gives you proper feedback.

     So if you are not sure if you have installed the required packages at
     all or if you have installed the correct versions of these packages then
     do not worry about this, just go on with the following installation
     steps: If ECB is missing something it will give you proper feedback and
     support not later than at load-time or start-time!

  2. Download and unpack the ECB archive (probably you have already done this
     :-)

  3. Add the new ECB-directory to your `load-path' variable.

     You *MUST* add the ECB-install-directory to the `load-path' either by
     changing the `load-path' variable directly in your `.emacs' or
     `site-lisp/site-start.el' or by working with a file `subdirs.el'(1).

     So for example the needed entry for your `.emacs'-file could be:

        (add-to-list 'load-path
                     "/path/to/your/ecb/installation/directory")

     *ATTENTION*: ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is not
     added to `load-path' and for example just loaded by

        (load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")

     Do not do this! It will not work!

  4. Load ECB by adding code to your `.emacs':

     If you want to load the complete ECB at (X)Emacs-loadtime (Advantage:
     All ECB-options available after loading ECB. Disadvantage: Increasing
     loadtime(2)):

        (require 'ecb)

     If you want to load the ECB first after starting it by `ecb-activate'
     (Advantage: Fast loading(3).  Disadvantage: ECB- and semantic-options
     first available after starting ECB):

        (require 'ecb-autoloads)

     This loads all available autoloads of ECB, e.g. `ecb-activate',
     `ecb-minor-mode', `ecb-byte-compile' and `ecb-show-help'.

     Regardless which method you prefer: In both cases the used statement
     must be placed *after* the statement of step 3!

  5. Restart (X)Emacs.

ECB is now ready for use and can be activated by calling `M-x ecb-activate'
or `ecb-minor-mode'. Now you can either starting using ECB or you can do
these optional installation steps:

  6. Reading the online help with `ecb-show-help'

     Maybe you are interested to read the online-help of ECB before first
     start.

  7. Bytecompiling ECB with `ecb-byte-compile'

     This byte compiles ECB. You can safely ignore all messages if there are
     any. (You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by using
     the `Makefile' or by using the batch-file `make.bat'; just read the
     comments in that file you choose.)

  8. Installing the Info-help of ECB

     The ECB distribution contains a subdirectory `info-help' which contains
     the online-help of ECB in Info-format. You can install this online help
     so it's available in the Top-directory of Info. There are two ways to do
     this:

        - Use "install-info" (recommended):

            1. Copy the files of the subdirectory `info-help' into the
               info-directory of Emacs

            2. Install the file `info-help/ecb.info' with the command
               "install-info" (if available on your system) in the `dir'-file.

          The supplied `Makefile' offers a target `install-help' which does
          both of these steps. You have just to call `make install-help' with
          the correct EMACSINFOPATH set (see the comment in `Makefile'). Here
          is an example:

             make EMACSINFOPATH=/path/to/emacs/info install-help

        - Manually Installation:

          Copy the files of the subdirectory `info-help' into the
          info-directory of Emacs and modify the file `dir' manually.

     But it doesn't matter if you do not execute this step (8.) because the
     online help of ECB is always available though, see `ecb-show-help'.

Usage
-----

Call "M-x ecb-activate" to activated ECB.

Call "M-x ecb-customize-most-important" to get a list of the most important
options of ECB. These are options you should at least know that they exist.

Call "M-x ecb-show-help" to get a detailed online-help for ECB. If you are
using ECB the first time you should read the online help accurately!
