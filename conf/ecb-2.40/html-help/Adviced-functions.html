<h3 class="section">11.4 How to deal with the adviced functions</h3>

<p>ECB needs a bunch of advices so ECB can work correctly. ECB has a
powerful advice-backbone which allows defining sets of adviced
functions whereas a set means, that all advices of a certain set are
always enabled or disabled together.

   <p>For this ECB contains four macros:

     <ul>
<li><code>defecb-advice-set</code>
<li><code>defecb-advice</code>
<li><code>ecb-with-original-adviced-function-set</code>
<li><code>ecb-with-ecb-advice</code> (for this one see below)
</ul>

   <p>For a detailed explanation of each macro read the documentation with
<code>describe-function</code>!

   <p>An advice in ECB must not being defined by <code>defadvice</code> but only
with <code>defecb-advice</code> which in turn needs a previously defined
advice-set defined by <code>defecb-advice-set</code>.

   <p>So ECB has always full control of all advices. For example ECB
automatically disables all advices of all advice-sets at load-time of
ECB and also at deactivation time of ECB. So you can be sure that
after deactivating ECB all ecb-advices are deactivated/disabled too.

   <p>In addition to the four macros above ECB offers two further macros
for running code with disabled some ecb-advices:

     <ul>
<li><code>ecb-with-original-basic-functions</code>
<li><code>ecb-with-original-permanent-layout-functions</code>
</ul>

   <p>The advice set <code>ecb-basic-adviced-functions</code> contains most of the
ecb-advices. See the contents of this variable to see which advices
are contained in this set. Use
<code>ecb-with-original-basic-functions</code> when you want evaluating
elisp-code with disabled basic-advices. 
<code>ecb-with-original-basic-functions</code> is only a shortcut for
<code>ecb-with-original-adviced-function-set</code> called for the
<code>ecb-basic-adviced-functions</code>-set.

   <p>Same for <code>ecb-with-original-permanent-layout-functions</code> which is a
shortcut for the advice-set <code>ecb-permanent-adviced-layout-functions</code>.

   <p>Last but not least ECB contains an advice-set
<code>ecb-always-disabled-advices</code>. These advices are always disabled. 
This advice-set can not be enabled by <code>ecb-enable-advices</code> but
such an advice has to be activated 'on demand' by the caller. Such an
advice must be used with the macro <code>ecb-with-ecb-advice</code> (see the
docstring) and is also enabled within the BODY of the macro-call.

   <p>ECB contains some more advice-sets but don't bother about it.

   <p><strong>Please Note</strong>: See the value of <code>ecb-adviced-function-sets</code> which
advice-sets are defined and see <code>ecb-adviced-functions</code> for an overview
for all adviced functions.
