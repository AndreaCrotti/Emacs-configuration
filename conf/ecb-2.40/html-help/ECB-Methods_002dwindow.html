<h4 class="subsection">4.1.5 The ECB Methods-window</h4>

<p><a name="index-Methods-5"></a>The <dfn>ECB-Methods</dfn> ECB-window contains all parsed and recognized tags
of the current source-buffer. It is called &ldquo;Method-buffer&rdquo; because
ECB is mostly designed for browsing sourcecode files and for
programming-languages these tags are often methods (and variables
etc.) To simplify explanations we talk in the following only about
methods and variables - but in general the method-buffer can contain
any kind of tags (e.g. sections and subsections for texinfo
buffers).

   <p>Per default the content of the methods-ECB-window is automatically
synchronized and updated with current point of the current source-buffer in
the edit-area (see <a href="ECB_002dwindow-synchronizing.html#ECB_002dwindow-synchronizing">ECB-window synchronizing</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.5.1 Usage of the methods ECB-window</h5>

     <ul>
<li>When a node (e.g. method or variable) is selected with the primary mouse
button (see <a href="Using-the-mouse.html#Using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</a>) or RETURN (see <a href="Using-the-keyboard.html#Using-the-keyboard">Using the keyboard</a>) the
buffer in the edit-window (which one depends on the setting in
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>) will jump to the method/variable.

     <p>IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e. hold down the SHIFT-key
while clicking with the primary mouse button (see <a href="Using-the-mouse.html#Using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</a>)
or RETURN (see <a href="Using-the-keyboard.html#Using-the-keyboard">Using the keyboard</a>)) on a node in this buffer then
the edit-buffer will be narrowed to the selected tag (see also
option <code>ecb-tag-visit-post-actions</code>). But this works only for
sources parsed by semantic, not by imenu or etags!

     <li>Clicking on a node with the secondary mouse button or C-RETURN
(see <a href="Usage-of-ECB.html#Usage-of-ECB">Usage of ECB</a>) will jump to the method in another edit window
- which one depends on the setting in
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>.

     <li>Right clicking on a node will open a popup menu where
different operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be
performed. The popup-menu offers commands for filtering the displayed
tree-nodes, hiding/narrowing the related tags in the source-buffer and
expanding/collapsing one/all tree-nodes according to a certain
expansion-level.

</ul>

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.5.2 Activating/Displaying the methods ECB-window</h5>

<p>Either use one of the predefined layouts which contain the methods
ECB-window (see <a href="Changing-the-ECB_002dlayout.html#Changing-the-ECB_002dlayout">Changing the ECB-layout</a>) (e.g. via <kbd>C-c . l
c</kbd>) or create a new ecb-layout via the command
<code>ecb-create-new-layout</code> and add a buffer of type &ldquo;methods&rdquo; into
this new layout (see <a href="Creating-a-new-ECB_002dlayout.html#Creating-a-new-ECB_002dlayout">Creating a new ECB-layout</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.5.3 Synchronizing the Methods-window with current source-buffer</h5>

<p>First a preliminary remark: Do not confuse this chapter with that
synchronizing described in <a href="ECB_002dwindow-synchronizing.html#ECB_002dwindow-synchronizing">ECB-window synchronizing</a>. The latter one
describes the mechanism for synchronizing the ECB-windows when the
current-buffer in the edit-area has been changed. This chapter describes how
to synchronize the ECB-methods-window with the contents of the current-buffer
if the buffer has been modified!

   <p>Now lets start:

   <p>Generally ECB calls semantic to get the list of tags for current source-file
of current edit-window. Per default ECB does never automatically force a
reparse of the source-file after this has been changed - this is only done on
demand by calling the command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>. So per
default the idle-scheduler of semantic is responsible for reparsing the
source-file when this is necessary (see `semantic-idle-scheduler-mode' for
further details). So this scheduler is also repsonsible in turn for
updating/sychronizing the methods-window with current buffer-contents. This is
the most user-resonsible and therefore the recommended approach.

   <p>So it's strongly recommended to enable <code>semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> or
<code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> (see <a href="Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic.html#Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic">Setting up CEDET/semantic</a>)
because then reparsing is always done during idle-time of Emacs and - maybe
even more important - it is also interruptable.

   <p>But if this idle-scheduler is switched off then ECB offers now two
possibilities (via <code>ecb-force-reparse-when-semantic-idle-scheduler-off</code>):

     <ul>
<li>
Not forcing itself a reparse when tags are needed by ECB: then a user declines
knowingly Emacs/semantic-driven parsing of code when he/she switches off the
idle-mode of semantic. This is the default behavior of ECB and the default
value of this option. But this has also the consequence that the
methods-buffer is only filed on demand via <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>
(bound to &lt;C-c . r&gt;)!

     <p>This means also in consequence that the methods-buffer is not
automatically filled when a source-file is opened but first on demand
after calling the command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>!

     <li>
Forcing a reparse when tags are needed: Then ECB forces semantic to parse
the source-file when ECB needs tags to display. For this behavior this
option has to be set to not nil. 
</ul>

   <p>The term &ldquo;forcing a reparse by semantic&rdquo; is a simplification: ECB uses then
the function <code>semantic-fetch-tags</code> which can decide that the cached tags
are up-to-date so no real reparsing is necessary - but it can also run a full
reparse and this reparse is not being done when Emacs is idle but immediatelly
and not interruptable (as with the idle-scheduler of semantic), which can be
quite annoying with big source-files.

   <p>To make a long story short: It is strongly recommended to enable the
<code>semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> or
<code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code>! See <a href="Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic.html#Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic">Setting up CEDET/semantic</a>. This will give you in all cases the behavior you would expect
of en IDE like ECB/semantic.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.5.4 Synchronizing with indirect buffers</h5>

<p>ECB works out of the box with indirect buffers, especially with indirect
buffer clones created with the command <code>clone-indirect-buffer</code> (only
available with GNU Emacs &gt;= 21). They will be handled as all other buffers and
you can work with them with no difference to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; buffers. With one
exception:

   <p><strong>Please note</strong>: Cause of a bug in Emacs 22 (and maybe also in Emacs 23)
the propagation of parsing informations from one buffer to all others which are
in an indirect-buffer relation to the same base-buffer does currently not
work.

   <p>What does this mean: If you modify a buffer then Emacs propagates this change
to all buffers with the same base-buffer. ECB/semantic recognize this change
and do all necessary to automatically reparse the changed buffer (at least if
you have customized semantic/ECB to do this). So far so good, but: If you
switch to another buffer with the same base-buffer then you will notice that
the methods-window of ECB still displays the contents before the change, ie. 
the need for a reparse has not been propagated to these other buffers. This is
a bug in Emacs.

   <p>What can you do: As long as this bug is not fixed there is no chance that all
other affected &ldquo;indirect-related&rdquo; buffers will be reparsed automatically
after modifying one of them. So you have to do this reparse &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; after
switching to such an indirect-related buffer, but this is very simple: Just
call the command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code> with prefix arg or hit
&lt;C-u C-c . r&gt; (key this command is bound to).

   <p>Lets make an example:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>
Suppose we have a sourcefile test.java loaded as a buffer into Emacs and
suppose further we have created two indirect-buffer clones test-clone1.java and
test-clone2.java - all of these buffers point to the same file: test.java.

     <li>
Now lets be the buffer test-clone1.java the current buffer and let us modify
it (e.g. adding a new method). If you have enabled the idle-reparse mechanism
of semantic (see <a href="Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic.html#Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic">Setting up CEDET/semantic</a>) then this buffer will be
reparsed automatically and ECBs methods-window will be updated in turn too.

     <li>
So far so good. But if you now switch to one of the two other buffers, lets
say to test.java, then you will notice that the change done in
test-clone1.java is also visible in the buffer test.java but the
ECB-methods-window for test.java will display the contents before the change. 
This is cause of the Emacs-bug described above.

     <li>
To update the methods-window for test.java to the new contents you have to call
<code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code> with prefix argument (ie. clear-cache is
true) or hitting &lt;C-u C-c . r&gt;. Note: Calling this command without prefix
argument is not enough!

        </ol>

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.5.5 Jumping to the definition of external types</h5>

<p>There are two common types of &ldquo;external&rdquo; tags displayed in the
method-window, mostly with object oriented programing-languages:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>parent-types

     <p>Tags which represent the type of a parent-class (which can be defined in the
same file but which is more often defined in another file). All parents
(regardless if defined internaly or externaly) of a type will be displayed
under a bucket &ldquo;[Parents]&rdquo; in the methods-window of ECB.

     <li>&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; types

     <p>In OO-languages like CLOS, eieio and C++ there can be nodes with type-tags in
the method-buffer which are somehow virtual because there is no definition in
the current source-file. But such a virtual type collects all its outside
defined members like methods in C++ which are defined in the <samp><span class="file">*.cc</span></samp> file
whereas the class-definition is defined in the associated header-file.

        </ol>

   <p>In both cases the user wants to jump to the definition of the type if he clicks
onto the related node in the methods-window of ECB.

   <p>Here is a C++-example for &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; types (2) and parent types (1) which
explains this in detail:

   <p>Let's say this class is defined in a file <samp><span class="file">ParentClass.h</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">   class ParentClass
   {
   protected:
     int p;
   };
</pre>
   <p>Let's say this class is defined in a file <samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.h</span></samp>

<pre class="example">   #include "ParentClass.h"
   
   class ClassWithExternals : public ParentClass
   {
   private:
     int i;
   
   public:
     ClassWithExternals();
     ~ClassWithExternals();
   };
</pre>
   <p>Both the constructor and the destructor of the class
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; are implemented in a file
<samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.cc</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">   #include "test.h"
   
   ClassWithExternals::ClassWithExternals(int i,
                                          boolean b,
                                          char c)
   {
     return;
   }
   
   void
   ClassWithExternals::~ClassWithExternals()
   {
     return;
   }
</pre>
   <p>ECB displays the contents of <samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.cc</span></samp> in its methods-buffer like
follows:

<pre class="example">   [-] [Includes]
    `- test.h
   [-] ClassWithExternals
    |  +ClassWithExternals (+i:int, +b:class boolean, +c:char):ClassWithExternals
    `- +~ClassWithExternals ():void
</pre>
   <p>Both the constructor and the destructor of the class
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; are grouped under their class-type. But this class-type
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; is represented by a so called &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; or &ldquo;faux&rdquo;
node-tag, i.e. there is no real tag in the current source-buffer for this tag.

   <p>If a user now clicks onto the node of &ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; then he wants to
jump to the right location in the right file where &ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; is
defined. ECB now uses now some smart mechanisms (see below) to do this. In
case of success (means ECB has found the definition) it opens the right file
and point will stay at beginning of the definition of the type
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo;.

   <p>The contents of <samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.h</span></samp> are then displayed like
follows:

<pre class="example">   [-] [Includes]
    `- ParentClass.h
   [-] ClassWithExternals:class
    |  [-] [Parents]
    |   `- ParentClass
    |  [-] [Variables]
    |   `- -i:int
    |  +ClassWithExternals ():ClassWithExternals
    |  +~ClassWithExternals ():void
    `- [+] [Misc]
</pre>
   <p>Now let's play it again: Now we want to go to the definition of the
parent-type &ldquo;ParentClass&rdquo; when we click onto the related node under the
bucket &ldquo;[Parents]&rdquo;. Again ECB uses its smartness to jump to the definition
of the class &ldquo;ParentClass&rdquo; when you click onto the node &ldquo;ParentClass&rdquo;.

   <p>Now lets explain the precondition which must be fulfilled so ECB can do its
job:

     <ul>
<li>Customizing the semantic analyzer for your needs

     <p>ECB itself is quite stupid concerning finding external tags. But it can use
the semantic-analyzer of the CEDET-suite (remember: The CEDET-suite is a
must-requirement of ECB, see <a href="Requirements.html#Requirements">Requirements</a>). But this in turn means that the
semantic-analyzer must be customized in the right way for the needs of your
programing projects. Mainly this means activating semanticdb and setting the
correct include-path etc...

     <p><strong>Please note</strong>: Read the related manuals of semantic and - strongly
recommended - read in addition the article &ldquo;Gentle introduction to Cedet&rdquo;. 
It's worth to read it! The website of CEDET contains a link, you find it here:
<a href="http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html">http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html</a>

     <li>Customize the related options of ECB:

     <p>There is exactly one option you have to take into account:
<code>ecb-find-external-tag-functions</code>. This defines the method ECB uses to
find these external tags.

     <p>Mostly there is nothing to do because the default values should do a good job. 
But if things are running bad then maybe this is the right screw for you.

     <p>Finding such external types can be very complex and there are several roads to
success. ECB uses per default methods based on the semantic-analyzer. But this
option allows to define own find-functions and tell ECB to uses them.

     <p>This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e. for every major-mode a
different setting can be used. ECB first performs all find-functions defined
for current major-mode (if any) anf then all find-functions defined for the
special symbol 'default (if any).

     <p>ECB offers some predefined senseful finding-functions. Currently there are:

          <ul>
<li><code>ecb-search-tag-by-semantic-analyzer</code>: The most powerfil one, based
on the semantic-analyzer
<li><code>ecb-search-tag-by-semanticdb</code>: A backup for the first one
<li><code>ecb-jde-show-class-source</code>: For major-mode <code>jde-mode</code> when
coding in java, uses java-mechanisms - maybe for java the best choice. 
</ul>

     <p>See the documentation of the option and also of these function for details how
they work and how to write own finding-functions.

   </ul>
