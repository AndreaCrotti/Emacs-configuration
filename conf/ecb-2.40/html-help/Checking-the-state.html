<h4 class="subsection">10.8.2 How ECB checks the VC-state of a file</h4>

<p>After ECB has identified the VC-backend of a directory it will display
the VC-state (e.g. up-to-date, edited, needs-mergs etc...) with a
suitable image-icon in the tree-windows of the ECB-file-browser. To
get this state for a certain file ECB uses that check-state-function
stored in the cache for the directory of that file (see <a href="Identifying-backends.html#Identifying-backends">Identifying backends</a>).

   <p>You can add any arbitrary functions as check-state-function to
<code>ecb-vc-supported-backends</code> as long as they get one
filename-argument and return a state-symbol (e.g. <code>up-to-date</code>. 
ECB can understand a certain set of state-values which are then
mapped to suitable image-icons which will in turn be displayed in
front of the filename in the file-browser. Because the values a
check-state-function return can differ from that state-values ECB
understands, ECB offers an option to define a appropriate
state-mapping. The name of this option is <code>ecb-vc-state-mapping</code>. 
See the documentation of this option to get a list of all state-value
ECB understands.

   <p>Per default ECB uses the function <code>vc-state</code> of the
VC-package<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> to check the state for the
backends CVS, RCS, SCCS, Subversion, Git and Monotone. So the default-value of
<code>ecb-vc-state-mapping</code> contains a mapping between these values
<code>ecb-vc-state</code> can return and that state-values ECB understands.

   <p>If ECB should support other VC-backends than CVS, RCS, SCCS, Monotone, Git and
Subversion (e.g. Clearcase) you should add that new backend to the VC-package
(see the initial comments of vc.el how to do this) then ECB will automatically
support that new backend. Alternatively it may be sufficient if you write your
own check-state-function for this backend and add the needed mapping to
<code>ecb-vc-state-mapping</code> if necessary.

<h5 class="subsubsection">10.8.2.1 Getting heuristic state-values or real ones for a backend</h5>

<p>The interface of Emacs' VC-package offers two different ways to
get the VC-state of a file:

     <ul>
<li>The real, fresh and expensive approach

     <p>VC has a function <code>vc-recompute-state</code> which always performs a real
backend command (e.g. &ldquo;cvs status&rdquo; for CVS) to get a fresh and real state
for a file. As you can imagine this operation can be very expensive and long
lasting depending on the location of the repository. But for CVS the
CVS-backend of VC offers with the option <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> a way to
tell Emacs to stay local even for the sake of getting a real
state<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

     <p>ECB offers <code>ecb-vc-recompute-state</code> for this approach which is an alias
for <code>vc-recompute-state</code>.

     <li>The heuristic approach:

     <p>The function <code>vc-state</code> always returns a &ldquo;heuristic&rdquo; state
which should be used when a fresh and real state is not necessary. 
With <code>vc-state</code> the option <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> will never
take effect.

     <p>ECB offers <code>ecb-vc-state</code> for this approach - see below for the
difference between <code>vc-state</code> and <code>ecb-vc-state</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Example CVS:

   <p>VC/CVS actually does it this way (regardless if ECB is active or
not): When you visit a file, it always uses just the heuristic to get the
state (comparing file times), regardless of the setting of
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>. This is because the "fresh-but-slow" state is
determined by calling "cvs status" on the file, and this was deemed
unacceptably slow if done at visiting time under any conditions.

   <p>The state is updated by calling <code>vc-recompute-state</code> prior to
<code>vc-next-action</code> (C-x v v) which either checks a file in or out. 
IF <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> is nil, then this does in fact call "cvs
status" to get the "fresh-but-slow-state", but if
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> is t, then it just compares the file times
again.

   <p>But under certain conditions (e.g. if called for files not already
visited or for files their VC-state has been changed from outside
Emacs, e.g. by checking in the file via command line) <code>vc-state</code>
does not compute a new heuristic state but returns a cached one
(cached by the VC-package itself not by ECB) which does not reflect
the current VC-state. Example: if you have edited a file within Emacs
and then checked in from outside Emacs <code>vc-state</code> returns a wrong
state until you call <code>revert-buffer</code> for this file. Therefore ECB
offers the check-state-function <code>ecb-vc-state</code> which does the
same as <code>vc-state</code> but it clears the internal caches of the
VC-package for that file before calling <code>vc-state</code>.

   <p>The bottom line for you is this: If you use <code>ecb-vc-state</code> in
<code>ecb-vc-supported-backends</code> to get the version control state, then you
get the same policy that VC uses and you get always a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; heuristic
state (as correct as possible a heuristic state can be). There should no harm
if you use <code>ecb-vc-recompute-state</code> (which is an alias for
<code>vc-recompute-state</code>) as a replacement function if you want to get fresh
and real state-values, but then (a) you must make sure to set
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to nil, and (b) fetching the state over the network
under all conditions was deemed unacceptably slow in VC.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The VC-package of Emacs offers a standardised and uniform
interface for several backends; per default CVS, RCS, SCCS, Subversion, Git
and Monotone are supported by the VC-package.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> For other backends you have to check the VC-manual if there is
equivalent option</p>
