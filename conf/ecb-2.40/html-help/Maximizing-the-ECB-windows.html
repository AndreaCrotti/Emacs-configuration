<h3 class="section">6.10 Maximizing the ECB windows</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">6.10.1 How to maximize and minimize special ecb-tree-windows</h4>

<p>To get a better overlook about the contents of a certain ECB-window
every ECB-window can be &ldquo;maximized&rdquo;, means all other ECB-windows are
deleted so only the edit-window(s) and this maximized ECB-window are
visible (and maybe a compile-window if active). There are several ways
to do this:

     <ul>
<li>Via the node-popup-menus of the ECB-windows

     <li>Via the main &ldquo;ECB&rdquo;-menu and here &ldquo;Display window maximized&rdquo;

     <li>Via calling the adviced version of
<code>delete-other-windows</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> (bound to <kbd>C-x 1</kbd>) in one of
the ECB windows.

     <li>Via one of the commands <code>ecb-maximize-window-directories</code>,
<code>ecb-maximize-window-sources</code>, <code>ecb-maximize-window-methods</code>,
<code>ecb-maximize-window-history</code> or
<code>ecb-maximize-window-speedbar</code> or the bound short-cuts for those
commands.

     <li>Via the new command <code>ecb-cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers</code> which
cycles through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing exactly
one of the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.

     <li>Via the option <code>ecb-maximize-ecb-window-after-selection</code> and then
just by selecting an ECB-window. &ldquo;Deselecting&rdquo; an ECB-window brings
back all ECB-windows of current layout.

     <li>Via the default modeline-mechanisms for deleting other windows. GNU
Emacs binds <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> in its modeline to
<code>delete-other-window</code>. XEmacs binds a popup-menu with some window
commands to <kbd>button-3</kbd> in its modeline.

     <p>ECB combines the best of both worlds by supporting both of these
mechanisms for both Xemacs and Emacs: ECB binds a toggle-command to
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> in the modeline of each tree-buffer which maximizes the
current tree-window if all ECB-windows are visible and displays all
ECB-windows if current tree-window is maximized. In addition ECB binds
a popup-menu to <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> which offers exactly 2 commands:
Maximizing current tree-window and displaying all ECB-windows. 
</ul>

   <p>&ldquo;Minimizing&rdquo; such a maximized ECB-window, i.e. bringing back to its
original size and displays all ecb-windows of current layout, can
simply be done by redrawing the layout via the command
<code>ecb-redraw-layout</code> (bound to <kbd>C-c . lr</kbd>).

<h4 class="subsection">6.10.2 Selecting a node in a maximized ecb-tree-window</h4>

<p>When you select a node (either via mouse or RET) in a maximized
tree-window the default behavior of ECB is the following:

   <p>Maximized directories-window: When selecting a directory then first
automatically the maximized directories-window will be &ldquo;minimized&rdquo;
(i.e. all ecb-windows of current layout are displayed) if the current
layout contains a sources-buffer and no sources are shown in the
directories-window - see <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code>. 
So the source-files can be displayed in the sources-window.

   <p>Maximized sources- or history-window: When selecting a source-file in
one of these buffers then first automatically the maximized window
will be &ldquo;minimized&rdquo; (i.e. all ecb-windows of current layout are
displayed) if the current layout contains a methods-buffer. So the
tag-contents of the selected source-file can be displayed in the
methods-window.

   <p>For a even smarter behavior ECB offers the option
<code>ecb-maximize-next-after-maximized-select</code> which automatically
maximizes the next logical tree-window after a node selection. The
definition of &ldquo;next logical is&rdquo;: Directories &ndash;&gt; sources,
sources/history &ndash;&gt; methods. But if the current maximized tree-buffer
is also contained in the option
<code>ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code> (see also the
tree-buffer-command <code>ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code>
which is bound to &lt;C-t&gt; in each tree-buffer) then ECB does *not*
maximize the next logical tree-window but point stays in the currently
maximized tree-buffer so for example the user can select more than one
source-file from the sources-buffer.
