<h3 class="section">6.5 How the &ldquo;other window&rdquo; is determined by ECB</h3>

<p><a name="index-other-window-44"></a>Normally all windows in an Emacs-frame are arranged in a cyclic order
and window-selecting-commands like <code>other-window</code> or
window-scrolling-commands like <code>scroll-other-window</code> choose
simply the next<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> window after the current window as
&ldquo;other window&rdquo;.

<h4 class="subsection">6.5.1 &ldquo;Other window&rdquo;-basics in ECB</h4>

<p>With a typical window-layout of ECB such a cyclic order of
<strong>all</strong> windows in the ECB-frame does not make sense because it
would be not very intuitive and against that what the user wants to
&ldquo;say&rdquo; when calling <code>other-window</code> or
<code>scroll-other-window</code>.

   <p>Therefore ECB divides the whole set of windows of the ECB-frame in
several subsets:

     <ul>
<li>The edit-windows of the edit-area
<li>The special tree-windows for browsing-tasks
<li>The compile-window at the bottom (if there is one)
<li>The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame (if active)
</ul>

   <p>Each of these subsets will be treated as a cyclic ordered subset, i.e. 
all windows in each of these subsets are ordered as the function
<code>walk-windows</code> would visit the windows when the windows of a
subset would be the only windows of a
frame<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

<h4 class="subsection">6.5.2 Builtin &ldquo;other window&rdquo; behaviors of ECB</h4>

<p>ECB now offers to specify the behavior of commands like
<code>other-window</code> or <code>scroll-other-window</code> within the
ECB-frame. This can be done with the option
<code>ecb-other-window-behavior</code>. This option offers several builtin
behaviors:

     <ul>
<li>All windows of the ECB-frame are considered

     <p>ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll simply
the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the original
<code>other-window</code> rsp. the original
<code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>.

     <li>Only the windows of the edit-area are considered

     <p>ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only scroll
another edit-window. If the selected window is not an edit-window then
all windows are taken into account.

     <li>The edit-windows and the compile-window are considered

     <p>Like above but the compile-window will be added to the subset of the
edit-windows.

     <li>Behave as smart and intuitive as possible

     <p>This is the default behavior of ECB. ECB tries to choose the
<code>other-window</code>-destination or the &ldquo;other window&rdquo; to scroll in a
smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of the edit-windows and if
the edit-area is splitted then always the &ldquo;next&rdquo; edit-window is
choosen (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is the
first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
compile-window is used if there is one. In the context of an
<code>other-window</code>-call the <var>ARG</var> of <code>other-window</code> will be
taken into account.

     <p>If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the &ldquo;next&rdquo;
ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the last
ecb-window is the first ecb-window). In the context of an
<code>other-window</code>-call the <var>ARG</var> of <code>other-window</code> will be
taken into account. If there is only one ecb-window then ECB considers
also the edit-windows.

     <p>If the compile-window is selected then always the last edit-window
which had the point will be used unless <code>other-window</code> has been
called with a prefix-argument unequal 1. 
</ul>

   <p>Regardless of the different behaviors above ECB handles the situation
of an active minibuffer during a call to <code>other-window</code> or
<code>scroll-other-window</code> like follows:

   <p>If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the
window <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code> points to (when this variable
is set, otherwise the compile-window or the last selected edit-window
is choosen) when the called command is called to choose the 1. next
window (always true for scrolling another window or true when
<code>other-window</code> called without prefix-arg or with prefix-arg equal
1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen (in case of
<code>other-window</code>).

   <p>If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not
selected then <code>other-window</code> and <code>scroll-other-window</code>
behave like the original version.

<h4 class="subsection">6.5.3 User-defined &ldquo;other window&rdquo; behavior</h4>

<p>In addition to the builtin &ldquo;other window&rdquo; behaviors ECB offers a
user to completely define for himself how ECB should choose another
window for scrolling it or selecting it. This can be done with the
option <code>ecb-other-window-behavior</code> too because this option can
also have a function-symbol as value:

   <p>Such a function gets seven arguments:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the
<code>ecb-frame</code>
<li>A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
<li>A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
<li>The window-object of the compile-window if there is any. 
<li>The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active
minibuffer. 
<li>The result of the function <code>ecb-where-is-point</code> - see the
documentation of this function for details. 
<li>An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current
selected window the &ldquo;other-window&rdquo; is. Is nil when this function is
called in another context than for <code>other-window</code>.
        </ol>

   <p>The function has to return a window-object which is then used as
&ldquo;other window&rdquo; for the command <code>other-window</code> or for scrolling
another window (e.g. with <code>scroll-other-window</code>). Such a function
has to handle properly all situation for itself.

   <p>Here is an example for such a function:

<pre class="example">   (defun ecb-get-other-window-smart (win-list
                                      edit-win-list

                                      comp-win
                                      minibuf-win
                                      point-loc
                                      nth-window)
     "Implements the smart-setting of `ecb-other-window-behavior'."
     (if minibuf-win
         ;; if we have an active mini-buffer we delegate this to

         (ecb-get-other-window-minibuf-active win-list
                                              edit-win-list

                                              comp-win
                                              minibuf-win

       (let ((nth-win (or nth-window 1)))
         (cond ((equal point-loc 'ecb)
                (ecb-next-listelem ecb-win-list (selected-window) nth-win))
               ((equal point-loc 'compile)
                (if (= nth-win 1)
                    (or (and ecb-last-edit-window-with-point
                             (window-live-p ecb-last-edit-window-with-point)
                             ecb-last-edit-window-with-point)
                        (car edit-win-list))
                  (ecb-next-listelem (append edit-win-list
                                             (list (selected-window)))
                                     (selected-window)
                                     nth-win)))
               (t ;; must be an edit-window
                (ecb-next-listelem (append edit-win-list
                                           (if (and comp-win
                                                    (= (length edit-win-list)
                                                       1))
                                               (list comp-win)))
                                   (selected-window)
                                   nth-win))))))

   <p>This example implements the builtin smart behavior described above.
