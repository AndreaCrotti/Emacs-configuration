<h4 class="subsection">6.12.1 General synchronization aspects</h4>

<p>For each separate ECB-window-synchronization (remember: One common for the basic
ECB-windows, one for each add-on ECB-window) ECB offers the following
option-triple (demonstrated for the basic ECB-windows):

     <ul>
<li><code>ecb-basic-buffer-sync</code>:

     <p>Enables or disables the synchronization in general.

     <p>If active then the synchronization for the related ECB-window-buffers/windows
takes place whenever a buffer changes in an edit window or if another
edit-window with another buffer will be selected, if deactivated then never. 
But you can also set this option to a list of major-modes and then the sync. 
will only be done if the major-mode of the current buffer does NOT belong to
this list.

     <p>But in every case the synchronization only takes place if the
major-mode of the current-buffer in the current selected edit-window
has a relation to files or directories. Examples for the former one
are all programming-language-modes like <code>c++-mode</code> or
<code>java-mode</code>, <code>Info-mode</code> too, an example for the latter one
is <code>dired-mode</code>. For all major-modes related to
non-file/directory-buffers like <code>help-mode</code>,
<code>customize-mode</code> and others a synchronization will never be done!

     <p>It's recommended to exclude at least <code>Info-mode</code> because it makes
no sense to synchronize the ECB-windows after calling the Info help. 
Per default also <code>dired-mode</code> is excluded but it can also making
sense to synchronize the ECB-directories/sources windows with the
current directory of the dired-buffer in the edit-window.

     <li><code>ecb-basic-buffer-sync-delay</code>:

     <p>This option takes only effect if the synchronization is switched on via
<code>ecb-basic-buffer-sync</code> and determines when ECB synchronizes.

     <p>This option sets the time in seconds (fractions allowed) Emacs must be idle
before the related ECB-window(s) are synchronized. If nil then there is no
delay, means synchronization takes place immediately. A small value of about
0.25 seconds saves CPU resources and you get even though almost the same
effect as if you set no delay.

     <p>Per default ECB always synchronizes on idle-basis and it is strongly
recommened not to change this (ie. not setting the delay-option to nil)
because this can be very performance consuming (e.g. at least the check if a
synchronization must be performed is done after <strong>every</strong> key- or
mouse-button press!

     <p>Some fraction of a second is probably always the best choice, because it does
not cost cpu-power and nonetheless the synchronization takes place quite
immediately. So in most cases there is no need to bother with this option,
just use the default value.

     <li><code>ecb-basic-buffer-sync-hook</code>:

     <p>For each separate synchronization a hook variable is offered where you can
hook in with some elisp code if you need some tasks performed afterwards the
synchronization has been finished.

     <p>In most cases no hook will be needed.

   </ul>

   <p>Analogous to the shown options for the basic ECB-windows each add-on
ECB-window has its own separate triple of these options, named congruent to
the name of the buffer-name of the add-on ECB-window (e.g. for the analyse
ECB-window with the buffer-name hold in <code>ecb-analyse-buffer-name</code> these
three options are named <code>ecb-analyse-buffer-sync</code>,
<code>ecb-analyse-buffer-sync-delay</code> and <code>ecb-analyse-buffer-sync-hook</code>. 
For some specialities see <a href="Add_002don-synchronization.html#Add_002don-synchronization">Add-on synchronization</a>.

   <p><strong>Please note</strong>: With the command <code>ecb-window-sync</code> you can
do a manual synchronization if the automatic one is switched off or
if you just want to do this! See the documantation of this command.
