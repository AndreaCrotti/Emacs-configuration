<h4 class="subsection">6.8.5 Interactively creating new layouts</h4>

<p><a name="index-New-layouts-53"></a><a name="index-Creating-new-layouts-54"></a>
If you want to create your own ECB-layout then you can do this very
easy &ldquo;by example&rdquo; with the command <code>ecb-create-new-layout</code>. 
This command creates a new empty frame and offers a small set of keys
to create the new layout by splitting windows. 
<code>ecb-create-new-layout</code> and this couple of keys are your guide
during the layout-creation-process<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>After calling <code>ecb-create-new-layout</code> you will be asked which
type of layout you want to create: &ldquo;left&rdquo;, &ldquo;right&rdquo;, &ldquo;top&rdquo; or
&ldquo;left-right&rdquo;. Here you specify where the ECB-tree-windows/buffers
should be located in the ECB-frame:

     <ul>
<li>left: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the left side
<li>right: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the right side
<li>top: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the top side
<li>left-right: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the left and
right side
</ul>

   <p>Depending on the type you choose the window is splitted by the values
of the options <code>ecb-windows-width</code> (types &ldquo;left&rdquo;, &ldquo;right&rdquo; and
&ldquo;left-right&rdquo;) or <code>ecb-windows-height</code> (type &ldquo;top&rdquo;).

   <p>Afterwards you will see a frame like follows (here the layout-type is
&ldquo;left-right&rdquo;):

   <p>The big window (here the middle window) will be the edit-area of the
new layout and can not be selected, deleted or splitted during the
creation process. It displays the help-screen for the layout-creation
mode. Here all the available commands are displayed.

   <p>The small window(s) (here the left and right windows) can be splitted
by you wherever you want (<kbd>C-s</kbd>). The left one contains the point. 
You must give every ECB-tree-window you create a type (<kbd>C-t</kbd>)
which can be either

     <ul>
<li>One of the built-in types

     <p>This can be either &ldquo;directories&rdquo;, &ldquo;sources&rdquo;, &ldquo;methods&rdquo;,
&ldquo;history&rdquo; or &ldquo;speedbar&rdquo;.

     <li>Any user-defined type:

     <p>In this case you insert &ldquo;other&rdquo; after hitting <kbd>C-t</kbd> and you will
then be asked for the name of the user-defined type. You can insert
any arbitrary type name X. But to get this layout working you have to
define a function with name <code>ecb-set-X-buffer</code> whereas X is the
name of the user-defined type you have specified during
layout-creation.

     <p>This function <code>ecb-set-X-buffer</code> must be defined with the macro
<code>defecb-window-dedicator</code> and has to switch to the buffer you
want to display in this window. This macro automatically ensures that
this window is dedicated to that buffer.

     <p>Here is an example: Suppose you have inserted as type name &ldquo;example&rdquo;
then you have to define and load a function
<code>ecb-set-example-buffer</code> which could be defined like follows:

     <pre class="example">        (defecb-window-dedicator ecb-set-example-buffer " *ECB example-buf*"
          (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create " *ECB example-buf*")))
   </pre>
     <p>If you forget to define such a function for the user-defined type then
nevertheless ECB will draw this layout but it will use the
default-function <code>ecb-set-default-ecb-buffer</code> instead. 
</ul>

   <p>If you are satisfied with your new layout just hit <kbd>C-q</kbd>. You will
be asked for a new layout-name (TAB-completion is offered to get a
list of all names already in use) and after inserting a new(!) name
the new layout is saved in the file defined by the option
<code>ecb-create-layout-file</code>. The new layout is now available via the
option <code>ecb-layout-name</code>.

   <p>There is no need for you to load the file
<code>ecb-create-layout-file</code> manually into your Emacs because it's
automatically loaded by ECB!

   <p><strong>Please note</strong>: During the layout-creation process only the
commands displayed in the help-screen are available. ALL other
commands are temporally disabled (even the mouse-commands).

   <p>For programming new layouts with emacs-lisp see <a href="The-layout_002dengine.html#The-layout_002dengine">The layout-engine</a>.

   <p>With the command <code>ecb-delete-new-layout</code> you can delete
previously created layouts (TAB-completion is offered for all names of
user created layouts).

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> During the creation
process you will be asked in the minibuffer for several options; here
you can use TAB-completion and an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; RET chooses always the
first option!</p>
