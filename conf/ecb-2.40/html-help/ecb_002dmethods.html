        <p>This option has only an effect if option <code>ecb-highlight-tag-with-point</code> is
switched on too. There are three possible choices:
          <ul>
<li><code>nil</code>:
No auto. expanding of the method buffer. 
<li><code>expand-spec</code>:
Auto expand the method-buffer nodes if the node belonging to current
tag under point is invisible because its parent-node is collapsed. 
But expanding is only done if the type of the tag under point in the
edit-buffer is contained in <code>ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec</code>. 
<li><code>all</code>:
Like expand-spec but expands all tags regardless of the setting in
<code>ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec</code>.

are several choices:

          <ul>
<li>Only if on tag:
This means collapsing all nodes which have no relevance for the
currently highlighted node will be collapsed, because they are not
necessary to make the highlighted node visible. But do this only if
point stays onto a tag in the selected edit-window.

          <li>Always:
Same as before but collapse also when point doesn't stays on a tag
(e.g. between two defuns in elisp) in the selected edit-window. This
means in such a situation a full collapsing of the methods-buffer.

          <li>Never:
Do not automatically collapse the methods-buffer.

default tag-filters for certain files which are applied automatically
after loading such a file into a buffer. The possible filters are the
same as offered by the command <code>ecb-methods-filter</code> and they are
applied in the same manner - the only difference is they are applied
automatically. Please be aware that symbol-filters (e.g. 
protection-symbols like public or private) must not be inserted with
quotes whereas a filter-regexp has to be inserted with surrounding
double-quotes! In addition backslashes in a regexp have to be doubled!

        <p>For each file-spec (a major-mode plus a file-regexp which both specify
a file for which filters should be applied) there can be as much
filters as needed - they are layered like with
<code>ecb-methods-filter</code> too.

        <p>Tag-classes which are completely hidden or excluded by the option
<code>ecb-show-tags</code> will never being displayed in the Methods-buffer
regardless of the filters of this option!

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>disable-semantic-threshold-alist</b><var><a name="index-disable_002dsemantic_002dthreshold_002dalist-207"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Threshold for disabling semantic-parsing Define a threshold fpr
buffer-size. Exceeding this threshold disables parsing current buffer
by semantic.

        <p>This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e. for every
major-mode a different setting can be used. The value of this option
is a list of cons-cells:

          <ul>
<li>The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol 'default which
means if no setting for a certain major-mode is defined then the cdr of
the 'default cons-cell is used. 
<li>The cdr is an integer which defines the threshold for the buffer-size for
this major-mode. 
</ul>

        <p>Example:

     <pre class="example">          ((default . 1000000)
            (c-mode . 200000))
   </pre>
        <p>This example whould not parse c-mode buffers exceeding a buffer-size
of 200000. And buffers of all other modes would be only parsed if
smaller than 1000000.

        <p>A setting of <code>((c-mode . 200000))</code> would only restrict c-mode
buffers to a size of 200000 but would parse all other buffer
regardless their size.

expanding is switched off after explicit expanding or collapsing by

        <p>This is done with <code>ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree</code> so after
the switch off the auto expanding feature can again switched on
quickly.

        <p>But after explicitly expanding/collapsing the methods-buffer to a
certain level the auto. expanding could undo this when the node
belonging to current tag under point in the current active edit-window
is invisible after <code>ecb-expand-methods-nodes</code> - then the auto. 
expand feature would make this node immediately visible and destroys
the explicitly set expand-level.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>find-external-tag-functions</b><var><a name="index-find_002dexternal_002dtag_002dfunctions-211"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Functions used for searching external tags clicked in the methods buffer.

        <p>The methods buffer displays for oo-languages the parents of a type under a
special bucket &ldquo;Parents&rdquo;. Languages like C++, CLOS and Eieio allow to define
the implementation of a method outside of the class definition and even in
another file. In the methods-buffer of ECB such externaly defined methods are
collected and displayed under a <code>virtual</code> faux type-tag named as the
class-qualifier of the methods. This faux-tag is virtual because it does not
extist in the parsed buffer.

        <p>If a user clicks either onto such a faux-type-tag or onto a parent-tag then
ECB tries to find the definition of the underlying type on a name-basis,
displaying the containing file as buffer in the current edit-window and
jumping to the start of the type-definition in this buffer.

        <p>Finding such external types can be very complex and there are several roads to
success. ECB uses per default methods based on the semantic-analyzer. But this
option allows to define own find-functions and tell ECB to uses them.

        <p>This functionality is set on a <code>major-mode</code> base, i.e. for every
<code>major-mode</code> a different setting can be used. The value of this option is
a list of cons-cells: The car is either a <code>major-mode</code> symbol or the
special symbol 'default. The cdr is a list of find-functions or nil.

        <p>ECB first performs all find-functions defined for current <code>major-mode</code>
(if any) anf then all find-functions defined for the special symbol 'default
(if any).

        <p>ECB offers some predefined senseful finding-functions. Currently there are:
          <ul>
<li><code>ecb-search-tag-by-semantic-analyzer</code> (most powerful)
<li><code>ecb-search-tag-by-semanticdb</code>
<li><code>ecb-jde-show-class-source</code> (for major-mode <code>jde-mode</code> when
coding in java)
</ul>

        <p>This function does not only the searching but displays the founded tag. See
the documentation of these function for details how they work.

        <p>But you can add any arbitrary function if the following conditions are
fulfilled:

          <ul>
<li>The function gets a semantic tag representing the external type which should
be found. This is a positionless-tag (otherwise it would not be hard to go
to it) and it's either a faux-tag (for which <code>ecb--semantic-faux-tag-p</code> is
not nil; the function can use this check if necessary) or a simple tag
containing only a name an a tag-class. The tag-class for both is 'type.

          <li>The return value of the function must be one of:
               <ul>
<li><code>nil</code>: No tag is found
<li><code>t</code>: A tag has been found and also be displayed in the edit-window (this
prevents ECB from running further function of this option because the searched
tag is already displayed. So a function should only return <code>t</code> if all is
fine and no further actions are needed. 
<li>A positioned semantic tag (for which <code>ecb--semantic-tag-with-position-p</code>
returns not <code>nil</code>) which represents the found external type-tag. 
</ul>
          </ul>

        <p>It's strongly recommended for the function not to display the found location
for itself but to return a positioned semantic tag! But sometimes the
displaying is integrated in a third-party find-function like
<code>jde-show-class-source</code> which is used by
<code>ecb-jde-show-class-source</code>. In these cases the function has to return t
if the searched tag has been successfully displayed.

        <p>Precondition for a find-function:
Current buffer is the buffer the clicked faux- or parent tag belongs to
Current point depends on the clicked tag:
          <ul>
<li>In case of a faux-tag it's the start of the first child of the
faux-tag. There must be at least one adopted child-tag because
otherwise we would not have the faux-tag
<li>In case of an external parent-tag its the the start of the
external tag itself. 
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Time Emacs must be idle before current tag is highlighted. If nil
then there is no delay, means current tag is highlighted
immediately. A small value of about 0.25 seconds saves CPU resources
and you get even though almost the same effect as if you set no delay. 
But such a delay prevents also &ldquo;jumping backward/forward&rdquo; during
scrolling within java-classes if point goes out of method-definition
into class-definition. Therefore the default value is a delay of 0.25
seconds.

are three different choices:

     <pre class="example">        (&lt;tag type&gt; &lt;display type&gt; &lt;sort method&gt;)
   </pre>
        <p>There can be more than 1 element for a certain &lt;tag type&gt;. This is for
example useful for C++ and C because these languages distinct between
a method-prototype (rsp. function-prototype for C) and the method
(rsp. function for C) itself. The default value of these option
contains two entries for &lt;tag type&gt; is <code>function</code> whereas the
first one is responsible for the &ldquo;real&rdquo; methods (rsp. functions) and
the second one for the prototypes. So if the methods should be
flattened and the prototypes collapsed the show-tags-list for C++ and
C must contain two entries for &lt;tag type&gt; <code>function</code>, the first
one defined as <code>flattened</code> and the second one defined as
<code>collapsed</code>.

        <p>The tags in the methods buffer are displayed in the order as they appear in
this list.

          <dl>
<dt><code>&lt;tag type&gt;</code><dd>A Semantic tag type symbol (function, variable, rule, include etc.) 
or one of the following:

               <ul>
<li><code>t</code>: All tag types not specified anywhere else in the list. 
<li><code>parent</code>: The parents of a type. 
</ul>

          <br><dt><code>&lt;display type&gt;</code><dd>A symbol which describes how the tags of this type shall be shown:

               <ul>
<li><code>expanded</code>: The tags are shown in an expanded node. 
<li><code>collapsed</code>: The tags are shown in a collapsed node. 
<li><code>flattened</code>: The tags are added to the parent node. 
<li><code>hidden</code>: The tags are not shown. 
</ul>

               <ul>
<li><code>name</code>:
Sort by the tag name. 
<li><code>access</code>:
Sort by tag access (public, protected, private) and then by name. 
<li><code>nil</code>:
Don't sort tags. They appear in the same order as in the source
buffer.

<blockquote><p>Function to use for displaying tags in the methods buffer. This
functionality is set on major-mode base, i.e. for every major-mode a
different function can be used. The value of this option is a list of
cons-cells:

          <ul>
<li>The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol 'default which
means if no function for a certain major-mode is defined then the cdr of
the 'default cons-cell is used. 
<li>The cdr is the function used for displaying a tag in the related
major-mode. 
</ul>

        <p>Every function is called with 3 arguments:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The tag
<li>The parent-tag of tag (can be nil)
<li>The value of <code>ecb-font-lock-tags</code>.
             </ol>

        <p>Every function must return the display of the tag as string,
colorized if the third argument is not nil.

        <p>The following functions are predefined:

          <ul>
<li>For each element E of <code>ecb--semantic-format-function-alist</code>
exists a function with name &ldquo;ecb&ndash;&lt;(cdr E)&gt;&rdquo;. These functions are
just aliase to the builtin format-functions of semantic. See the
docstring of these functions to see what they do. Example:
(semantic-name-nonterminal . semantic-format-tag-name) is an element
of <code>ecb--semantic-format-function-alist</code>. Therefore the
alias-function for this element is named
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-name</code>.

          <li>For every cdr in <code>ecb--semantic-format-function-alist</code> with name
&ldquo;semantic-XYZ&rdquo; a function with name &ldquo;ecb-XYC&rdquo; is predefined. The
differences between the semantic- and the ECB-version are:

               <ul>
<li>The ECB-version displays for type tags only the type-name and nothing
else (exception: In c++-mode a template specifier is appended to the
type-name if a template instead a normal class). 
<li>The ECB-version displays type-tags according to the setting in
<code>ecb-type-tag-display</code>. This is useful for better recognizing
different classes, structs etc. in the ECB-method window. 
</ul>

          <p>For all tags which are not types the display of the ECB-version is
identical to the semantic version. Example: For
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-name</code> (one of the builtin semantic
formatters) the pendant is <code>ecb-format-tag-name</code>. 
</ul>

        <p>This functionality also allows the user to display tags as UML. To
enable this functionality set the function for a major-mode \(e.g. 
<code>jde-mode</code>) to
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-uml-concise-prototype</code>,
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-uml-prototype</code>, or
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-uml-abbreviate</code> the ECB-versions of
these functions.

        <p>If the value is <code>nil</code>, i.e. neither a function for a major-mode
is defined nor the special 'default, then
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-prototype</code> is used for displaying the
tags.

        <p>ECB first performs all actions defined for the special symbol 'default

<code>ecb-tag-visit-goto-doc-start</code>
<code>ecb-tag-visit-narrow-tag</code> See the documentation of these
function for details what they do.

        <p>But you can add any arbitrary function if the following conditions are
fulfilled: The function gets the semantic tag as argument, returns the

<blockquote><p>How to display semantic type-tags in the methods buffer. Normally
all tag displaying, colorizing and facing is done by semantic
according to the value returned by
<code>ecb--semantic-format-face-alist</code> and the semantic
display-function (e.g. one from
<code>ecb--semantic-format-tag-functions</code>). But sometimes a finer
distinction in displaying the different type specifiers of type-tags
can be useful. For a description when this option is evaluated look at
<code>ecb-tag-display-function</code>!

        <p>This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e. for every
major-mode a different setting can be used. The value of this option
is a list of cons-cells:

          <ul>
<li>The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol 'default which
means if no setting for a certain major-mode is defined then the cdr of
the 'default cons-cell is used.

          <li>The cdr is a list of 3-element-lists:

               <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>First entry is a semantic type specifier in string-form. Current
available type specifiers are for example &ldquo;class&rdquo;, &ldquo;interface&rdquo;,
&ldquo;struct&rdquo;, &ldquo;typedef&rdquo; and &ldquo;enum&rdquo;. In addition to these ones there
is also a special ECB type specifier &ldquo;group&rdquo; which is related to
grouping tags (see <code>ecb-post-process-semantic-taglist</code> and
<code>ecb-group-function-tags-with-parents</code>). Any arbitrary
specifier can be set here but if it is not &ldquo;group&rdquo; or not known by
semantic it will be useless. 
<li>Second entry is a flag which indicates if the type-specifier string
from (1.) itself should be removed (if there is any) from the display. 
<li>Third entry is the face which is used in the ECB-method window to
display type-tags with this specifier. ECB has some predefined faces
for this (<code>ecb-type-tag-class-face</code>,
<code>ecb-type-tag-interface-face</code>, <code>ecb-type-tag-struct-face</code>,
<code>ecb-type-tag-typedef-face</code>, <code>ecb-type-tag-union-face</code>,
<code>ecb-type-tag-enum-face</code> and <code>ecb-type-tag-group-face</code>) but
any arbitrary face can be set here. This face is merged with the faces
semantic already uses to display a tag,
i.e. the result is a display where all face-attributes of the ECB-face
take effect plus all face-attributes of the semantic-faces which are not
set in the ECB-face (with XEmacs this merge doesn't work so here the
ECB-face replaces the semantic-faces; this may be fixed in future
versions).
               </ol>
</ul>

        <p>The default value is nil means there is no special ECB-displaying of
type-tags in addition to the displaying and colorizing semantic
does. But a value like the following could be a useful setting:

     <pre class="example">        ((default
           ("class" t ecb-type-tag-class-face)
           ("group" nil ecb-type-tag-group-face))
         (c-mode
          ("struct" nil ecb-type-tag-struct-face)
          ("typedef" nil ecb-type-tag-typedef-face)))
   </pre>
        <p>This means that in <code>c-mode</code> only &ldquo;struct&rdquo;s and &ldquo;typedef&rdquo;s are
displayed with special faces (the specifiers itself are not removed)
and in all other modes &ldquo;class&rdquo;s and grouping-tags (see
<code>ecb-tag-display-function</code>,
<code>ecb-group-function-tags-with-parents</code>) have special faces and
the &ldquo;class&rdquo; specifier-string is removed from the display.
