<h4 class="subsection">11.3.1 General description of tree-buffers</h4>

<p>This subchapter is a general introduction in the main concepts of a
tree-buffer.

<h5 class="subsubsection">11.3.1.1 What is a tree-buffer?</h5>

<p>A <dfn>tree-buffer</dfn> is meant to display certain informations (e.g. a
directory-tree) in a tree-structure consisting of <dfn>tree-nodes</dfn>. 
Every line in a tree-buffer displays exactly one tree-node. Each node
has exactly one parent-node and can have any arbitrary number of
<dfn>children</dfn>-nodes. If a tree-node has no children then it is called
a <dfn>leaf</dfn>. A tree-node contains several &ldquo;slots&rdquo; wheras the most
important ones are the &ldquo;name&rdquo;, &ldquo;displayed-name&rdquo; and &ldquo;data&rdquo;. See
<a href="A-new-tree_002dnode.html#A-new-tree_002dnode">A new tree-node</a> for a detailed explanation.

   <p>The difference between a natural tree like a fir and a tree-buffer is
that the root(-node) of a tree-buffer is not visible but only its
children. In the example below the nodes parent-node-1 and
parent-node-2 are the children of the invisible root-node. Each
tree-buffer has exactly one root-node which is created automatically
by `tree-buffer-create'.

   <p>If a tree-node contains at least one child it is displayed with a
special expand/collapse-symbol (see the example below). This symbol
allows expanding (rsp. collapsing) the tree-node wheras expanding
means to display the children-nodes and collapsing means to hide the
childrens of a tree-node.

   <p>Here is an example of a tree-buffer:

<pre class="example">   &lt;root-node&gt;  ------------------------[root-node (invisible)]
       [+] &lt;parent-node-1&gt;  -------.
       [-] &lt;parent-node-2&gt;  -------|
           [-] &lt;expanded&gt;  --------|
               &lt;leaf-node-1&gt;  -----|
               &lt;leaf-node-2&gt;  -----|-----[tree-nodes]
               &lt;leaf-node-3&gt;  -----|
               &lt;leaf-node-4&gt;  -----|
           [+] &lt;collapsed&gt;  -------´
            |
            `-----------------[expand/collapse-symbol]
</pre>
   <p>In most cases an action is triggered when clicking with the mouse onto
a tree-node<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> (e.g. clicking onto
&ldquo;leaf-node-1&rdquo; or &ldquo;parent-node-1&rdquo; in the example above). Which
action is triggered by which key depends on what you specify at
creation-time of the tree-buffer - see <a href="A-new-tree_002dbuffer.html#A-new-tree_002dbuffer">A new tree-buffer</a> for
details.

   <p>The creation-interface of a tree-buffer allows defining special
popup-menus when clicking with the right mouse-button (of course also
possible via keyboard, see <a href="Tree_002dbuffer-keybindings.html#Tree_002dbuffer-keybindings">Tree-buffer keybindings</a>) onto a
tree-node (e.g. some senseful actions possible for directory-nodes
like grepping this directory or performing version-control actions for
this directory or something else).

<h5 class="subsubsection">11.3.1.2 General recipe for a tree-buffer</h5>

<p>The following sequence of tasks is the general recipe for a
tree-buffer beginning from creation and ending with the display.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Create the tree-buffer
Creating a new tree-buffer has to be done with
<code>tree-buffer-create</code> for non ECB-tree-buffers and with the macro
<code>defecb-tree-buffer-creator</code> when the tree-buffer should be used
as an ECB-tree-buffer, so it is an ECB-window. See <a href="A-new-tree_002dbuffer.html#A-new-tree_002dbuffer">A new tree-buffer</a> for all details.

     <li>Add tree-nodes to the tree-buffer
Adding nodes to the new tree-buffer (means make the new tree-buffer
the current buffer and call <code>tree-node-new</code> for a new tree-node
(note that a root-node for this tree-buffer has been autom. created by
<code>tree-buffer-create</code>!). The first tree-node you add to a
tree-buffer must have always the root-node (avaliable via
<code>tree-buffer-get-root</code>) as parent-node. The next nodes can have
either one of the fromerly added nodes or the root-node too. All
tree-nodes haveing the root-node as parent will be displayed at the
toplevel of the tree-buffer. See <a href="A-new-tree_002dnode.html#A-new-tree_002dnode">A new tree-node</a> for all
details.

     <li>Display the tree-buffer with current nodes and state
When you are finished building up the tree-node-structure call
<code>tree-buffer-update</code> to display the current tree-structure (again
after making the tree-buffer the current-buffer). See <a href="Updating-a-tree_002dbuffer.html#Updating-a-tree_002dbuffer">Updating a tree-buffer</a> for all details.
        </ol>

   <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: First a call of <code>tree-buffer-update</code> updates
the <strong>display</strong> of a tree-buffer, means shows all the tree-nodes
in an emacs-buffer! Neither creating a tree-buffer nor adding
tree-nodes display anything; this just builds the internal
tree-structure.

   <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: See <a href="Programming-special-windows.html#Programming-special-windows">Programming special windows</a> for details
about programming ECB-windows (special windows) regardless if they
were build as tree or not. There you can find a.o. how to
automatically synchronizing a special window with the current
edit-buffer.
