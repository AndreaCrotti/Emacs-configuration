<h3 class="section">10.15 Support of several Emacs-window-managers</h3>

<p><a name="index-winring-353"></a><a name="index-escreen-354"></a><a name="index-window_002dmanager-355"></a>There are several window-managers available which offer an easy
interface to jump between different window-configurations within the
same frame. A window configuration is the layout of windows and
associated buffers within a frame. There is always at least one
configuration, the current configuration. You can create new
configurations and cycle through the layouts in either direction. 
Window configurations are often named or numbered, and you can jump to
and delete named rsp. numbered configurations.

   <p>Without special support by ECB these window-managers would not work in
combination with ECB!

   <p>ECB currently supports the following managers:

     <ul>
<li>winring.el:

<a href="http://www.python.org/emacs/winring">http://www.python.org/emacs/winring</a>

     <li>escreen.el:
Written by Noah Friedman <a href="mailto:friedman@splode.com">friedman@splode.com</a>, available at
<a href="http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/#ui">http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/#ui</a>
</ul>

   <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: With one of these window-managers installed and
active you can run applications like Gnus, VM or BBDB in the same
frame as ECB! Just use different window-configurations (winring.el) or
escreens (escreen.el) for ECB and the other applications. Especially
with winring.el you can give every configuration a descriptive name
like &ldquo;ECB&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gnus&rdquo;; afterwards you can jump to a
window-configuration by name!

   <p>When you go back to the ECB-window-configuration (winring.el) or the
ECB-escreen (escreen.el) with any of the special
window-manager-commands then the state of ECB will be restored exactly
as you have left it when going to another window-configuration rsp. 
escreen. This includes the whole splitting state of the edit-area and
the visibilty of the ecb-windows and of the compile-window!

   <p>The rest of this section describes how to enable the special
ECB-support for these window-managers and how to use them.

<h4 class="subsection">10.15.1 Enabling of the support</h4>

<p>Every support must be enabled explicitly:
     <ul>
<li>winring:
Call <code>ecb-winman-winring-enable-support</code>. This <strong>MUST</strong> be
done <strong>BEFORE</strong> the first call to any winring-command, so also
before calling <code>winring-initialize</code>!

     <li>escreen:
Call <code>ecb-winman-escreen-enable-support</code>. This <strong>MUST</strong> be
done <strong>BEFORE</strong> the first call to any escreen-command, so also
before calling <code>escreen-install</code>! 
</ul>

   <p>If a window-manager-support should be enabled autom. after Emacs-start
just put the following into your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

<pre class="lisp">   (ecb-winman-winring-enable-support)
   (winring-initialize)
   
   ;; or - if you like escreen more
   
   (ecb-winman-escreen-enable-support)
   (escreen-install)
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">10.15.2 Usage of a window-manager in combination with ECB</h4>

<p>After enabling the support of one of the supported window-managers
just go on as described in the commentary or introduction of the
respective library-file(s) of the window-manager. Here is a short
description:

     <ul>
<li>winring:
First you have to define how to identify the ECB-window-configuration,
i.e. the configuration with activated ECB. This done with the option
<code>ecb-winman-winring-name</code>. There is always only one
window-configurations with name <code>ecb-winman-winring-name</code>!

     <p>Then run <code>winring-initialize</code>. If ECB is active then the
resulting window-configuration is the ECB-window-configuration. 
Otherwise you can create the ECB-window-configuration when you first
time call <code>winring-new-configuration</code> with name equal to
<code>ecb-winman-winring-name</code>. In general you can run all commands of
the winring-library. If you jump to the ECB-window-configuration then
ECB will be autom. activated and if you leave the
ECB-window-configuration then ECB will autom. deactivated.

     <li>escreen:
First you have to define how to identify the ECB-escreen
i.e. that escreen with activated ECB. This done with the option
<code>ecb-winman-escreen-number</code>. There is always only one
escreen with number <code>ecb-winman-escreen-number</code>!

     <p>Then run <code>escreen-install</code> (deactivates ECB if currently
running). After that you can call <code>escreen-create-screen</code> and
<code>escreen-goto-screen</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. These commands autom. activate ECB
if creating or selecting the escreen with number
<code>ecb-escreen-number</code> (default = 1) and autom. deactivate ECB if
leaving the ECB-escreen. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">10.15.3 Disabling the support</h4>

<p>There is normally no need to do this but nevertheless it can be done
by <code>ecb-winman-escreen-disable-support</code> rsp. 
<code>ecb-winman-winring-disable-support</code>.

   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> And of course all other
<code>escreen-goto-*</code> commands!</p>
