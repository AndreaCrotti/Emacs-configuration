<h4 class="subsection">11.3.2 How to create a new tree-buffer</h4>

<p>The creator-function for a new tree-buffer depends on the fact if the
new tree-buffer should be used as an ECB-window or not. For a new
ECB-window the macro <code>defecb-tree-buffer-creator</code> has to be
used, otherwise the function <code>tree-buffer-create</code>. In the end
both methods use <code>tree-buffer-create</code> because the BODY-argument
of <code>defecb-tree-buffer-creator</code> must contain a call to this
function!.

   <p>This section describes all arguments of <code>tree-buffer-create</code>.

   <p>Except the first argument <var>NAME</var> all arguments are key-arguments
of the form :arg-name arg-value, so for example a call looks like

<pre class="example">   (tree-buffer-create &lt;buffer-name&gt; :frame &lt;frame-object&gt; ...).
</pre>
   <p>These key-arguments (all except the first argument <code>NAME</code>) can be
arranged in any arbitrary order but all of them are not-optional! The
key-arg-name is always a : followed by the lowercase version of the
mentioned argument below (e.g. <code>FRAME</code> &ndash;&gt; :frame,
<code>MOUSE-ACTION-TRIGGER</code> &ndash;&gt; :mouse-action-trigger).

   <p>Here is a description of the arguments of <code>tree-buffer-create</code> -
also available as docstring for this function (via <kbd>C-h f</kbd>). The
description below contains also some examples for complex-arguments!

     <dl>
<dt><code>NAME</code><dd>Buffername of the new tree-buffer.

     <br><dt><var>FRAME</var><dd>Frame in which the tree-buffer is displayed and valid. All
key-bindings and interactive functions of the tree-buffer work only if
called in <var>FRAME</var> otherwise nothing is done!

     <br><dt><var>MOUSE-ACTION-TRIGGER</var><dd>When a mouse-action is triggered. Allowed values:
<code>button-release</code> and <code>button-press</code>.

     <br><dt><var>IS-CLICK-VALID-FN</var><dd><code>tree-buffer-create</code> rebinds <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>,
<kbd>RET</kbd> (and <kbd>TAB</kbd>) and also in combination with shift and
control (not with <kbd>TAB</kbd>). <var>IS-CLICK-VALID-FN</var> is called first
if a node or an expand-symbol is clicked. This function is called with
five arguments:

          <ul>
<li>mouse-button:
The clicked mouse-button or RET or TAB (0 = RET or TAB, 1 = mouse-1, 2
= mouse 2)
<li>shift-pressed:
Non nil if the SHIFT-key was pressed during mouse-click or RET. 
<li>control-pressed:
Non nil if the CONTROL-key was pressed during mouse-click or RET. 
<li>meta-pressed:
Non nil if the META-key was pressed during mouse-click or RET. 
<li>tree-buffer-name:
The buffer-name of the tree-buffer where the node has been clicked. 
</ul>

     <p>The function must return not nil iff exactly this click/hit is
accepted. If the function returns nil then really nothing is done by
the tree-buffer after this click/hit!

     <p>Here is an example (call <kbd>C-h f</kbd> to see what it does) for this
callback-function:

     <pre class="example">        (defun ecb-interpret-mouse-click (mouse-button
                                          shift-pressed
                                          control-pressed
                                          meta-pressed
                                          tree-buffer-name)

                (mouse-1--mouse-2
                 (if control-pressed

                   (list mouse-button shift-pressed meta-pressed 'mouse)))

                (mouse-2--C-mouse-2
                 (if (not (eq mouse-button 2))

                (otherwise nil)))))
   </pre>
     <p>This example would be passed as parameter as follows:

     <pre class="example">        (tree-buffer-create "myname"
                            :is-click-valid-fn 'ecb-interpret-mouse-click

   </pre>
     <br><dt><var>NODE-SELECTED-FN</var><dd>Function to call if a node has been selected. This function

<li>shift-pressed
<li>control-pressed

     <p>For the last four arguments see the description above. This function
has to ensure that the expandable- and expanded-state of the selected
node is correct after returning.

     <p>Here is an example (call <kbd>C-h f</kbd> to see what it does) for this
callback-function:

   </pre>
     <p>This example would be passed as parameter as follows:

     <pre class="example">        (tree-buffer-create "myname"
                            :node-selected-fn 'ecb-tree-buffer-node-select-callback
                            ...)
   </pre>
     <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This callback must not modify the slot
<var>EXPANDED</var> of the passed node because this is done automatically
by the tree-buffer-library!

     <br><dt><var>NODE-EXPANDED-FN</var><dd>Function to call if a node is expandable, point stays onto the
expand-symbol and node is not already expanded. This function is
called with the following parameters:

          <ul>
<li>node: The selected node
<li>mouse-button (0 = TAB, 1 = mouse-1, 2 = mouse 2)
<li>shift-pressed
<li>control-pressed
<li>meta-pressed
<li>tree-buffer-name
</ul>

     <p>This function should add all children nodes to this node if not
already done (if possible). This function has to ensure that the
expandable- and expanded state of the selected node is correct after
returning!

     <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This callback must not modify the slot
<var>EXPANDED</var> of the passed node because this is done automatically
by the tree-buffer-library!

     <br><dt><var>NODE-COLLAPSED-FN</var><dd>Function to call if a node is expandable, point stays onto the
expand-symbol and node is already expanded. This function is called
with the following parameters:

          <ul>
<li>node: The selected node
<li>mouse-button (0 = TAB, 1 = mouse-1, 2 = mouse 2)
<li>shift-pressed
<li>control-pressed
<li>meta-pressed
<li>tree-buffer-name
</ul>

     <p>This function is only a callback to inform the owner/user of this
tree-buffer that this node has been collapsed. This function must not
modify the expandable- or expanded state of the selected node!

     <p>Often a sensefull value for this parameter is the function
<code>ignore</code>.

     <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This callback must not modify the slot
<var>EXPANDED</var> of the passed node because this is done automatically
by the tree-buffer-library!

     <br><dt><var>NODE-MOUSE-OVER-FN</var><dd>Function to call when the mouse is moved over a node. This function is
called with three arguments: NODE, WINDOW, NO-PRINT, each of them
related to the current tree-buffer. If NO-PRINT is nil then the
function must print the text itself in any manner. This function must
always return the text which either is printed by the function itself
or by the caller (if NO-PRINT is not nil). The current buffer for this
function is the tree-buffer itself. With XEmacs this function is only
called if the tree-buffer track-mouse mechanism is activated (see the
function <code>tree-buffer-activate-follow-mouse</code>). With GNU Emacs &gt;=
21 this function is called by the <code>help-echo</code> property added to
each node.

     <p>Here is an example (call <kbd>C-h f</kbd> to see what it does) for this
callback-function:

     <pre class="example">        (defun ecb-mouse-over-analyse-node (node &amp;optional window no-message
                                                 click-force)
          (let ((str (when (or click-force
                               (ecb-show-minibuffer-info
                                node window
                                (car ecb-analyse-show-node-info)))
                       (if (equal (cdr ecb-analyse-show-node-info)
                                  'full-info)
                           (ecb-analyse-gen-tag-info
                            (car (tree-node-&gt;data node)))
                         (tree-node-&gt;name node)))))
            (prog1 str
              (unless no-message
                (ecb-nolog-message str)))))
   </pre>
     <br><dt><var>MOUSE-HIGHLIGHT-FN</var><dd>If nil then in this tree-buffer no node is highlighted when the mouse
moves over it. If t then each node is highlighted when the mouse moves
over it. If a function then it is called with the node as argument and
if it returns not nil then the node will be highlighted when the mouse
moves over it - otherwise no highlighting takes place.

     <br><dt><var>NODE-DATA-EQUAL-FN</var><dd>Function used by the tree-buffer to test if the data of two tree-nodes
are equal. The function is called with two args: The DATA-slots of the
two tree-nodes (see <a href="A-new-tree_002dnode.html#A-new-tree_002dnode">A new tree-node</a> for details about the
data-slots).

     <p>Here is an example (call <kbd>C-h f</kbd> to see what it does) for this
callback-function:

     <pre class="example">        (defun ecb-analyse-compare-node-data (left right)
          "Return not nil when LEFT and RIGHT are identical node-datas."
          (and (equal (nth 2 left) (nth 2 right))
               (ecb-compare-methods-buffer-node-data (car left)
                                                     (car right))))
   </pre>
     <p>Often a suitable value for this parameter is <code>equal</code>.

     <br><dt><var>MAYBE-EMPTY-NODE-TYPES</var><dd>Nil or a list of node-types (a node-type is an integer which must be
set with <code>tree-node-new</code>). Nodes with one of these types are
treated as empty if they are not expandable (i.e. they have no
children) and will be displayed with the empty-symbol ([x]); for other
nodes see next argument.

     <br><dt><var>LEAF-NODE-TYPES</var><dd>Nil or a list of node-types (see above). Nodes with one of these types
are treated as leafs and will be displayed with the leaf-symbol (*).

     <p>Summary for <var>MAYBE-EMPTY-NODE-TYPES</var> and <var>LEAF-NODE-TYPES</var>:

          <ul>
<li>Expandable nodes will always be displayed either with the open- or
with the close-symbol.

          <li>Not-expandable nodes with a node-type contained in
<var>MAYBE-EMPTY-NODE-TYPES</var> will be displayed with the empty-symbol.

          <li>Not-expandable nodes with a node-type contained in
<var>LEAF-NODE-TYPES</var> will be displayed with the leaf-symbol.

          <li>All other nodes will be displayed with no symbol just with correct
indentation. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>MENU-CREATOR</var><dd>Nil or function which has to return nil or a list of conses, each cons
for a known node-type of this tree-buffer (the node-type of a node is
an integer). Example: ((0 . menu-for-type-0) (1 . menu-for-type-1)). 
The cdr of a cons must be a menu in the same format
<code>tree-buffer-create-menu</code> expects as argument - see the
documentation of this function for details. This function gets two
arguments: The name of the tree-buffer and the node for which a
popup-menu should be opened.

     <p>Here is an example for such a menu-creator-callback:

     <pre class="example">        (defconst ecb-analyse-nodedata-tag-with-pos 0)

parent node) or a node. This node will be displayed as sticky in the
header-line of the tree-buffer. If nil is returned and sticky-parent-p is not
nil then just the node under the header-line is displayed. If this argument is
nil and sticky-parent-p is not nil then always the next unvisible parent node
will be displayed in the header-line.

     <br><dt><var>TRUNC-LINES</var><dd>Should lines in this tree buffer be truncated (not nil).

     <br><dt><var>READ-ONLY</var><dd>Should the treebuffer be read-only (not nil).

     <br><dt><var>TREE-INDENT</var><dd>Spaces subnodes should be indented. Ignored if <var>TREE-STYLE</var> is
<code>image</code> (see below).

     <br><dt><var>INCR-SEARCH-P</var><dd>Should the incremental search be enabled in the tree-buffer. Three
choices: <code>prefix</code>, <code>substring</code>, <code>nil</code>. See the command
<code>tree-buffer-incremental-node-search</code>.

     <br><dt><var>INCR-SEARCH-ADDITIONAL-PATTERN</var><dd>Every search-pattern is prefixed with a regexp to jump over not
important stuff of a displayed node-name at incr. search.. This is per
default: beginning spaces and guide characters (|`-) and all
expand/collapse-buttons [+], [x], rsp. [-]!

     <p>If this argument is not nil then it must be a cons-cell where car is a
string which should be a regexp-pattern which is added to the
basic-prefix pattern (see above) and both of them prefix the
incr-search-pattern. The cdr is the number of subexpressions in this
additoonal pattern.

     <br><dt><var>ARROW-NAVIGATION</var><dd>If not nil then a smart navigation with arrow keys is offered:

          <ul>
<li>Left-arrow:
If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise point
jumps to the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree (higher means
the next higher tree-level or - if no higher level available - the next
higher node on the same level).

          <li>Right-arrow:
If node is not expanded then it will be expanded.

          <p>Onto a not expandable node the horizontal arrow-keys go one character in the
senseful correct direction.

          <li>Up- and down-key:
Point jumps to the first character of the previous (up) rsp. next node
(down). &ldquo;First&rdquo; character means either the first character of the
expand-symbol (in case <var>EXPAND-SYMBOL-BEFORE-P</var> is not nil) or of
the displayed node-name. Or with other words: The first
non-indentation and non-guide-line (see <var>TREE-STYLE</var>) character of
a node. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>HOR-SCROLL-STEP</var><dd>Number of columns a hor. scroll in the tree-buffer should scroll. If
not nil then <kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd> and <kbd>M-mouse-2</kbd> scroll left and right
and also <kbd>M-&lt;left-arrow&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>M-&lt;right-arrow&gt;</kbd>. Ignored with
XEmacs.

     <br><dt><var>DEFAULT-IMAGES-DIR</var><dd>Full path where the default images for the tree-buffer can be found. 
It should contain an image for every name of
<code>tree-buffer-tree-image-names</code>.

     <br><dt><var>ADDITIONAL-IMAGES-DIR</var><dd>Additional image-dir which should be searched first for images needed
for current tree-buffer. If the image can not be found in this
directory then <var>DEFAULT-IMAGES-DIR</var> is searched. If the image can't even
found here the related ascii-symbol is used.

     <br><dt><var>IMAGE-FILE-PREFIX</var><dd>Common prefix for all image-files for this tree-buffer, e.g. &ldquo;ecb-&rdquo;.

     <br><dt><var>TREE-STYLE</var><dd>There are three different styles available: Image-style (value
<code>image</code>): Very nice and modern because image-icons are used to display
the tree-buffer. For this style the arguments <var>TREE-INDENT</var> and
<var>EXPAND-SYMBOL-BEFORE-P</var> have no effect.

     <p>Ascii-style with guide-lines (value <code>ascii-guides</code>) and
ascii-style without guidelines (value <code>ascii-no-guides</code>. See
<a href="Tree_002dbuffer-styles.html#Tree_002dbuffer-styles">Tree-buffer styles</a> for details about the tree-styles.

     <p>Both ascii-styles are affected by the args <var>TREE-INDENT</var> and
<var>EXPAND-SYMBOL-BEFORE-P</var>.

     <br><dt><var>ASCII-GUIDE-FACE</var><dd>If <var>TREE-STYLE</var> is <code>ascii-guides</code> then this defines the face
the guides should be displayed with.

     <br><dt><var>TYPE-FACER</var><code>:</code><dd>Nil or a list of one or more conses, each cons for a node-type (a
node-type is an integer which must be set with <code>tree-node-new</code>). 
The cdr of a cons can be:

          <ul>
<li>a face-symbol

          <li>a function-symbol which gets two arguments (see
<code>tree-buffer-insert-text</code>). This function can do anything, but
normally it should face a tree-node.

          <li>the symbol t. Then the tree-buffer assumes that the node-text is
already faced and therefore it does not face the node, means it does
nothing then inserting the node-text, if the tree-buffer is updated. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>EXPAND-SYMBOL-BEFORE-P</var><dd>If not nil then the expand-symbol is displayed before the node-text. 
Ignored when <var>TREE-STYLE</var> is <code>image</code> and Emacs can display
images.

     <br><dt><var>HIGHLIGHT-NODE-FACE</var><dd>Face used for highlighting current selected node in this
tree-buffer.

     <br><dt><var>GENERAL-FACE</var><dd>General face in which the whole tree-buffer should be displayed.

     <br><dt><var>AFTER-CREATE-HOOK</var><code>:</code><dd>A function or a list of functions (with no arguments) called directly
after creating the tree-buffer and defining it's local keymap. For
example such a function can add additional key-bindings for this
tree-buffer local keymap (use <code>local-set-key</code> for this).

     <p>Here is an example for such a hook:

     <pre class="example">        (defun ecb-common-after-tree-buffer-create-actions ()
          "Things which should be performed after creating a tree-buffer.
        The tree-buffer is the current buffer."
          (local-set-key (kbd "C-t")
                         'ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select)
          (if ecb-running-xemacs
              (define-key modeline-map
                '(button2up)
                'ecb-toggle-maximize-ecb-window-with-mouse)
            (local-set-key [mode-line mouse-2]
                           'ecb-toggle-maximize-ecb-window-with-mouse)))
   </pre>
     <br><dt><var>AFTER-UPDATE-HOOK</var><code>:</code><dd>A function or a list of functions (with no arguments) called each time
after the tree-buffer has been updated via <code>tree-buffer-update</code>.

   </dl>
