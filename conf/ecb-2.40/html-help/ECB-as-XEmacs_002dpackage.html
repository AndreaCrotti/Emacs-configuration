<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Installation of ECB as a XEmacs-package</h4>

<p>This section is only relevant for XEmacs-users!

   <p>In previous versions of ECB XEmacs-users could use the
package-management-system of XEmacs for first-time downloading/installing ECB
or for upgrading to a newer version of ECB.

   <p>Beginning with version 2.33 ECB does no longer support the old versions of
semantic, eieio and speedbar not part of the CEDET-suite. ECB &gt;= 2.33 requires
fully installed CEDET-suite with version &gt;= 1.0pre6. This one is not available as
XEmacs-package. Therefore ECB can also not be run as XEmacs-package. If cedet
will become a XEmacs-package then probably ECB will come back as
XEmacs-package. But in the meanwhile you have to install ECB &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; as
described in the next section (see <a href="Standard-ECB_002dInstallation.html#Standard-ECB_002dInstallation">Standard ECB-Installation</a>).

<!-- @strong{Recommendation}: If you are able to manually install ECB and its -->
<!-- requirements as described in @ref{Standard ECB-Installation} then go on and -->
<!-- proceed with that (you will see, it's easy). You will get a much more powerful -->
<!-- ECB and also CEDET/semantic. -->
<!-- If you are desperate to use the package-management-system of ECB for -->
<!-- installing ECB, then here is a short guide (for details about the -->
<!-- package-manager of XEmacs see the related info-manual): -->
<!-- @strong{Caution}: If ECB is already installed and you just want -->
<!-- upgrading to a newer version then it is recommended to deactivate ECB -->
<!-- before proceeding with the steps below! -->
<!-- @enumerate -->
<!-- @item Choose a download-site -->
<!-- This can be done via the menu ``Tools -> Packages -> Add Download -->
<!-- Site'': Choose one of the listed sites. Or you can customize the -->
<!-- option @code{package-get-remote} by hand and save it for future -->
<!-- sessions. -->
<!-- @item Activate the packages list -->
<!-- This can be done either by the menu ``Tools -> Packages -> List and -->
<!-- Install'' or via the command @code{pui-list-packages}. After that a -->
<!-- special packages-buffer is displayed where you can interactively -->
<!-- install or upgrade packages. At the end of this buffer there is a -->
<!-- short description how to use this buffer. -->
<!-- @item Install ECB and all required packages -->
<!-- Mark the package named ``ecb'' for install. Do this also for the -->
<!-- required packages ``semantic'', ``eieio'' and ``speedbar''. The -->
<!-- package ``mail-lib'' is needed for easy submitting of problem-reports -->
<!-- to the ECB-maintainers and the package ``c-support'' is needed for -->
<!-- easy using hideshow within the Methods-buffer of ECB@footnote{All -->
<!-- required packages can simply autom. marked by hitting @kbd{r} in the -->
<!-- packages buffer. But this installs a lot of packages more (e.g. the -->
<!-- Newsreader Gnus) which are really not essential for ECB. Therefore it -->
<!-- is recommended to mark the required packages by hand.}. -->
<!-- After marking all needed packages for installation hit @kbd{x} to -->
<!-- install them. -->
<!-- If you have already installed ECB and you want just upgrading to the -->
<!-- latest available version then proceed as described above - same if you -->
<!-- want to upgrade one of the required packages. -->
<!-- @item Start ECB -->
<!-- Now you can immediately start ECB via the command @code{ecb-activate}; -->
<!-- there is no need to restart XEmacs! As an alternative you can first -->
<!-- read the online-help via @code{ecb-show-help}. -->
<!-- @end enumerate -->
<!-- If you do not like the package-manager of XEmacs but you want -->
<!-- installing ECB ``by hand'' direct from the ECB-website then you have -->
<!-- to follow the instructions in @ref{Standard ECB-Installation}. -->
