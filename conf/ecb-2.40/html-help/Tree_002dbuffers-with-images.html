<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.2.3 Which images are used for the tree</h5>

<p>Depending on the value of <code>ecb-tree-buffer-style</code> and the
image-support of (X)Emacs, the tree-buffer try to use images instead
of strings to draw a nice-looking tree.

   <p>If images can and should be used then the option
<code>ecb-tree-image-icons-directories</code> tells ECB where to search for
suitable image-icons for each of the nine image-names (see above). An
image is used for displaying a control with name &ldquo;XXX&rdquo; if one of the
directories of <code>ecb-tree-image-icons-directories</code> contains an
image-file with basename &ldquo;ecb-XXX&rdquo; and an extension which is
supported by (X)Emacs. Currently supported extensions are &ldquo;.xpm&rdquo;,
&ldquo;.png&rdquo;, &ldquo;.gif&rdquo;, &ldquo;.jpeg&rdquo;, .&rdquo;jpg&rdquo; and &ldquo;.xbm&rdquo;.

   <p>Example: To display the control with name &ldquo;open&rdquo; with a suitable
image then one of the directories of
<code>ecb-tree-image-icons-directories</code> must contain a file with name
&ldquo;ecb-open.xpm&rdquo; or &ldquo;ecb-open.png&rdquo; etc. See the description of this
option to get all important details how and in which sequence ECB
searches the directories of <code>ecb-tree-image-icons-directories</code>.

   <p>ECB comes with predefined default-images usable for every tree-buffer
and special images for the Directories- and the Methods-tree-buffer. 
They are defined in several different heights - so for the most
senseful font-heights of a tree-buffer a fitting image-size should be
available. The shipped images reside either in the subdirectory
"ecb-images" of the ECB-installation or - if ECB is installed as
regular XEmacs-package - in the ECB-etc data-directory (the directory
returned by evaluating (locate-data-directory "ecb"). If you do not
want to change the images then you normally have nothing to do because
the default value of <code>ecb-tree-image-icons-directories</code> points
already to the correct image-directories.

   <p>A special remark for XEmacs:

   <p>At least XEmacs 21.14 (but probably previous versions too) has a bug
in its display-engine which prevents adjacent images to be displayed
correctly. The effect is, that in a row of two or more adjacent images
(e.g. end-guide+handle+open - see the tree-example above) always all
images are masked by the last one, means only the last one is visible. 
If at least one normal character (e.g. a space) is placed between two
images then the images are displayed correctly. Therefore ECB has
implemented the following work-around to get best possible results
with XEmacs: open-, close-, empty-, leaf-, guide-, end-guide- and
no-guide-images are displayed with images and the handle- and the
no-handle-images are displayed with the corresponding ascii-symbols
(which is &ldquo;-&rdquo; rsp. &ldquo; &rdquo;). The face (the color) of the handle-symbol
is customizable via the option <code>ecb-tree-guide-line-face</code>.

   <p>This bug is already reported to the XEmacs-team. If your XEmacs has
fixed this bug then add the following to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>-file (or
whereever your emacs-setup is located):

<pre class="lisp">   (setq tree-buffer-enable-xemacs-image-bug-hack nil)
</pre>
   <p>Then ECB uses images without any special work-around with XEmacs too. 
Just try it - if the tree-buffers look ugly then the XEmacs-bug is
probably not fixed correctly.
