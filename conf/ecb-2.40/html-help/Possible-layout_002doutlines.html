<h4 class="subsection">11.5.3 The wide range of possible layout-outlines</h4>

<p>In the two previous sections <a href="Programming-a-new-layout.html#Programming-a-new-layout">Programming a new layout</a> and
<a href="Programming-special-windows.html#Programming-special-windows">Programming special windows</a> we have explained in detail how to
program new layouts and how to program new special windows/buffers and
adding them to a new layout.

   <p>The intention of this section is to be a summary what are the real
restrictions for a new layout-outline programmed with
<code>ecb-layout-define</code>. This is necessary because until now we just
programmed &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; layouts, means layout which are in principle
very similar to the standard ones which means one big edit-window and
some special windows &ldquo;around&rdquo; this edit-window. This section will
show you that a layout can have also very different outlines.

   <p>OK, here are the real restrictions and conditions for a layout
programmed with <code>ecb-layout-define</code>:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It must have exactly one edit-window regardless of its size. The user
of this layout can later split this edit-window in as many
edit-windows as he like.

     <li>All other windows created within the <var>CREATE-CODE</var> body of
<code>ecb-layout-define</code> (see <a href="Programming-a-new-layout.html#Programming-a-new-layout">Programming a new layout</a>) must be
dedicated to their buffers.

     <li>All the dedicated windows must (exclusive!) either reside on the left,
right, top or left-and-right side of the edit-window. This will be
defined with the <var>TYPE</var>-argument of <code>ecb-layout-define</code>
(see <a href="Programming-a-new-layout.html#Programming-a-new-layout">Programming a new layout</a>).
        </ol>

   <p>You see, there are only three restrictions/conditions. These and only
these must be fulfilled at layout-programming.

   <p>Demonstrating what this really means and how flexible the
layout-engine of ECB really is, can be done best with some
&ldquo;pathological&rdquo; layout-outlines. All the following are correct
layouts (working code is added below each layout):

   <p>The following is a top layout with three vertical layered special
windows.

<pre class="example">   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   <p>Here is the code for that top layout (all buffers are dummy-buffers):

<pre class="lisp">   
   ;; The "window dedicator" functions:

   (defecb-window-dedicator ecb-set-lsw-buffer "Lower special window"
     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "Lower special window")))
   
   ;; The layout itself:
   
   (ecb-layout-define "example-layout3" top
     nil
   
     ;; here we have an edit-window and above one top window which we can
     ;; now split in several other windows. Dependent on the value of
     ;; `ecb-compile-window-height' we have also a compile-window at the
     ;; bottom.
   
     (ecb-set-usw-buffer)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.33)

     (ecb-set-lsw-buffer)
   
     ;; select the edit-window.
     (select-window (next-window)))
</pre>
   <p>The following is a left-right layout which has six special windows in
the left-&rdquo;column&rdquo; and one big special window in the
right-&rdquo;column&rdquo;. For left-right layouts the left-&rdquo;column&rdquo; and the
right-&rdquo;column&rdquo; have always the same width.

   <p>Here is the code for that left-right layout, again with dummy-buffers
(depending to your screen-resolution you will need a quite big value
for <code>ecb-windows-width</code>, e.g. 0.4):

   <p>Here is one of the &ldquo;window dedicator&rdquo;-functions<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>:

<pre class="lisp">   (defecb-window-dedicator ecb-set-left1-buffer "Left1"
     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "Left1")))
</pre>
   <p>Here is the layout-definition itself:

<pre class="lisp">   (ecb-layout-define "example-layout2" left-right
     nil
   
     ;; here we have an edit-window and left and right two windows each
     ;; with width `ecb-windows-width'. Dependent to the value of
     ;; `ecb-compile-window-height' we have also a compile-window at the
     ;; bottom.
   
     (ecb-set-left1-buffer)
     (ecb-split-hor 0.66 t)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.75)
     (ecb-set-left4-buffer)
     (select-window (previous-window (selected-window) 0))
     (ecb-split-ver 0.25 nil t)
     (ecb-set-left2-buffer)
     (ecb-split-hor 0.5)
     (ecb-set-left3-buffer)
     (select-window (next-window (next-window)))
     (ecb-set-left5-buffer)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.5)
     (ecb-set-left6-buffer)
     (select-window (next-window (next-window)))
     (ecb-set-right1-buffer))
   
     ;; select the edit-window
     (select-window (previous-window (selected-window) 0)))
</pre>
   <p>Especially the last example should demonstrate that even very
complicated layouts are easy to program with <code>ecb-layout-define</code>. 
If such layouts are senseful is another topic ;-)

&ldquo;window dedicators&rdquo; for all these ecb-windows/buffers are
