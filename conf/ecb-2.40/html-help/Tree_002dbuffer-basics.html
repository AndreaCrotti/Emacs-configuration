<h4 class="subsection">4.1.1 General introduction into tree-buffers</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.1.1 Content and structure of a tree-buffer</h5>

<p>ECB displays most of its informations (e.g. about directory-structures
or file-contents) in so called <dfn>tree-buffers</dfn> which means the
display of such a tree-buffer is structured in a tree consisting of
<dfn>tree-nodes</dfn>. Every line in a tree-buffer displays exactly one
tree-node. Each node can have any arbitrary number of
<dfn>children</dfn>-nodes. If a tree-node has no children then it is called
a <dfn>leaf</dfn>.

   <p>Each tree-buffer of ECB is displayed in an own special
ECB-window/buffer which is read-only ie. not editable.

   <p>The difference between a natural tree like a fir and an ECB-tree is
that the root(-node) of a tree-buffer is not visible but only its
children. In the example below the nodes parent-node-1 and
parent-node-2 are the children of the invisible root-node.

   <p>If a tree-node contains at least one child it is displayed with a
special expand/collapse-symbol (see the example below). This symbol
allows expanding (rsp. collapsing) the tree-node wheras expanding
means to display the children-nodes and collapsing means to hide the
childrens of a tree-node.

   <p>Here is an example of a tree-buffer:

<pre class="example">   [+] parent-node-1  -------.
   [-] parent-node-2  -------|
       [-] expanded  --------|
           leaf-node-1  -----|
           leaf-node-2  -----|-----[tree-nodes]
           leaf-node-3  -----|
           leaf-node-4  -----|
       [+] collapsed  -------´
        |
        `-----------------[expand/collapse-symbol]
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.1.2 Possible actions for a tree-node</h5>

<p>In most cases an action is triggered when clicking with the mouse onto
a tree-node<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> (e.g. clicking onto &ldquo;leaf-node-1&rdquo; or
&ldquo;parent-node-1&rdquo; in the example above). Which actions depends on the
type of the tree-buffer. For example clicking on a tree-node in the
ECB-sources-buffer (which is the name of a source-file) opens the
relelated file in the edit-area of ECB (see <a href="ECB-Sources_002dwindow.html#ECB-Sources_002dwindow">ECB Sources-window</a>)
whereas clicking onto a node in the ECB-methods-buffer (which is the
name of a tag in the current source-file displayed in the edit-area)
&ldquo;jumps&rdquo; to the location of this tag in the source-buffer in the
edit-area (see <a href="ECB-Methods_002dwindow.html#ECB-Methods_002dwindow">ECB Methods-window</a>).

   <p>Almost every ECB-window of ECB offers a special popup-menu when
clicking with the right mouse-button (of course also possible via
keyboard, see <a href="Using-the-keyboard.html#Using-the-keyboard">Using the keyboard</a>) onto a tree-node (e.g. some
senseful actions possible for directory-nodes like grepping this
directory or performing version-control actions for this directory or
something else).

   <p>See <a href="ECB-Directories_002dwindow.html#ECB-Directories_002dwindow">ECB Directories-window</a>, <a href="ECB-Sources_002dwindow.html#ECB-Sources_002dwindow">ECB Sources-window</a>, <a href="ECB-Methods_002dwindow.html#ECB-Methods_002dwindow">ECB Methods-window</a> and <a href="Add_002don-ECB_002dwindows.html#Add_002don-ECB_002dwindows">Add-on ECB-windows</a> for a detailed description which
actions are triggered and which popup-menus are offered in all the ECB-windows
of ECB.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.1.1.3 Sticky parent-node for tree-buffers</h5>

<p>In the header-line (only for GNU Emacs) of a tree-buffer always the
current-parent node of the first visible node is displayed (if there is a
parent node). So a user always has a good overview to which parent a node
belongs. This sticky node is exactly in the same manner clickable as all other
nodes (see above).

   <p>There is a option <code>ecb-tree-make-parent-node-sticky</code> which
enabales/disables this feature (default is enabled).

   <p>There is also an option <code>ecb-tree-stickynode-indent-string</code>. Normally
there is no need to bother with this option but if you encounter
alignment-problems with the sticky node in the headerline then take a look at
this option, because it allows to fix the problem.

   <p>This feature is only available for GNU Emacs &gt;= 21.
