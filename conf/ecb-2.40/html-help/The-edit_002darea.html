<h3 class="section">6.3 Working with the edit-window(s) of the edit-area</h3>

<p><a name="index-edit_002dwindow-25"></a>ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-area as if the
edit-windows of the edit-area would be the only windows of the
ECB-frame.

   <p><a name="index-Adviced-functions-26"></a>ECB advices the following user-commands so they work best with ECB:

     <ul>
<li><code>balance-windows</code>
<li><code>delete-other-windows</code>
<li><code>delete-window</code>
<li><code>delete-windows-on</code>
<li><code>display-buffer</code>
<li><code>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</code>
<li><code>split-window</code>
<li><code>split-window-horizontally</code>
<li><code>split-window-vertically</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>other-window</code>
<li><code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>
</ul>

   <p>The behavior of the adviced functions is (slightly simplified):

     <ul>
<li>All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their corresponding
original functions but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB
would be the only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of
ECB seems to be a normal Emacs-frame to the user. This means that you
can split and delete edit-windows without any restriction - ECB
ensures that neither the special ECB-windows nor the compile-window
will be damaged.

     <li>If there is a persistent compile-window (see <a href="Temp_002d-and-compile_002dbuffers.html#Temp_002d-and-compile_002dbuffers">Temp- and compile-buffers</a>) then all compilation-buffers in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> will be displayed in the
compile-window.

     <li>If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions behave
exactly like the not adviced original versions! 
</ul>

   <p><strong>Please note</strong>: All these advices are only enabled when ECB is
enabled.

   <p>Another interesting option in the context of the edit-window and these
adviced functions is <code>ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</code>!

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.1 Documentation of the adviced window functions</h4>

<p>This section describes for every adviced window function (s.a.) how it
differs from the original version. Only the differences are mentioned,
so if you want the full documentation of such a function call
<code>describe-function</code> or <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.

        <p>If optional argument WINDOW is nil (i.e. probably called

This means the current edit-window which contains the point will be
destroyed and its place will be occupied from another one. If called
in an unsplitted edit-window then nothing is done. If called in the
compile-window of ECB then the compile-window will be hidden (like
with <code>ecb-toggle-compile-window</code>). If called in an ecb-window
of the current ECB-layout there are two alternatives:

          <ul>
<li>If the function is contained in
<code>ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</code> the right edit-window
is selected (depends on the value of the option
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>) and does then it´s job.

          <li>Otherwise the behavior depends on the value of the option
<code>ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error</code>. 
</ul>

        <p>If optional argument WINDOW is a living window (i.e. called from

This means all other edit-windows besides the current edit-window
which contains the point will be destroyed and the current edit-window
fills the whole edit-area. Neither the special ecb-windows nor the
compile-window will be destroyed!

          <ul>
<li>If called in an unsplitted edit-window then either the compile-window
will be hidden (if there is one) otherwise nothing is done.

          <li>If called in one of the ecb-windows then the current one is maximized,
i.e. the other ecb-windows (not the edit-windows!) are deleted.

          <li>If called in the compile window there are two alternatives:

               <ul>
<li>If the function is contained in

edit-windows otherwise the compile-window is deleted (if there is
one). If WINDOW is an ecb-window then only the other ecb-windows are
deleted and in all other cases the behavior depends on
