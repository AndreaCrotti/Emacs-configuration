<h3 class="section">12.1 Conflicts with other packages</h3>

<p>This chapter contains a list of already known conflict between ECB and
other packages and how to solve them - in most cases ECB already
contains a suitable workaround.

   <p>That is followed by a general recipe what you can do when you have
detected a conflict between ECB and a package is not listed in the
know-conflicts-section.

<h4 class="subsection">12.1.1 Proved workarounds or recommendations for other packages</h4>

<p>Here is a list of packages which are proved to work properly with ECB
and if not (i.e. there are conflicts) then helpful
solutions/hints/workarounds are offered:

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.1 Package bs.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-bs-package-359"></a><a name="index-bs_002dshow-360"></a>The package bs.el offers a nifty buffer-selection buffer. The main
command of this package is <code>bs-show</code>. With ECB &lt; 2.20 this
command does not really working well within activated ECB. But as of
version 2.20 of ECB there should be no problems using this package.

   <p>If you add &ldquo;*buffer-selection*&rdquo; as buffer-name to the option
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-names</code> then ECB will always display the
buffer-selection buffer of bs in the compile-window (if there is one). 
Otherwise bs will use the edit-area to do its job.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.2 Package BBDB</h5>

<p><a name="index-BBDB-361"></a>As of ECB 2.21 there should be no conflicts between BBDB and ECB, so
BBDB can be used even when the ECB-windows are visible.

   <p>But if you encounter problems then it is recommened to use one of the
window-managers escreen.el or winring.el (see <a href="Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB.html#Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>). With such a window-manager ECB and BBDB should work together
very well under all circumstances!

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.3 Package calendar.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-calendar-package-362"></a>With activated ECB <code>calendar</code> does not shrink it´s window to the small
size but splits the window equally. But if you add this to your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> it works:

<pre class="example">   (add-hook 'initial-calendar-window-hook
             (function (lambda ()
                         (when (and ecb-minor-mode
                                    (ecb-point-in-edit-window))
                           ;; if no horizontal split then nothing
                           ;; special to do
                           (or (= (frame-width) (window-width))
                               (shrink-window (- (window-height) 9))))
                        )))
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.4 Package cygwin-mount.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-cygwin_002dmount-package-363"></a>There can be a conflict between ECB and cygwin-mount.el if the
following conditions are true:

     <ul>
<li>You are working with cygwin-mount.el (sounds clear :-)
<li>You have set <code>cygwin-mount-build-mount-table-asynch</code> to not
nil
<li>ECB is automatically started after starting Emacs (e.g. with
<code>ecb-auto-activate</code> or calling <code>ecb-activate</code> in
<code>window-setup-hook</code>)
<li>Your Emacs-setup contains a call of <code>cygwin-mount-activate</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Under these circumstances Emacs 21.X sometimes eats up the whole CPU (at
least with Windows XP) and the cygwin-mount-table is never build.

   <p>But there is an easy work-around: Call <code>cygwin-mount-activate</code>
first *AFTER* ECB is activated. This can be done with the hook
<code>ecb-activate-hook</code>:

<pre class="example">   (add-hook 'ecb-activate-hook
             (function (lambda ()
                         (require 'cygwin-mount)
                         (setq cygwin-mount-build-mount-table-asynch t)
                         (cygwin-mount-activate))))
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.5 Package desktop.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-desktop-364"></a>ECB works perfectly with the desktop-saver desktop.el. Normally there should
be nothing to do for you.

   <p>But if you encounter problems (e.g. that desktop tries to activate ECB for
each buffer it loads) then you should add the following entry to the option
<code>desktop-minor-mode-table</code>:

<pre class="example">   (ecb-minor-mode nil)
</pre>
   <p>If you still encounter problems then you should add entries for all the
minor-mode of the semantic-package to <code>desktop-minor-mode-table</code>, so for
example add also:

<pre class="example">   (semantic-decoration-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-completions-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-tag-highlight-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-summary-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-scheduler-mode nil)
   (senator-isearch-semantic-mode nil)
   (senator-minor-mode nil)
   (semantic-highlight-func-mode nil)
   (semantic-stickyfunc-mode nil)
   (semantic-show-parser-state-mode nil)
   (semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode nil
   (semantic-highlight-edits-mode nil
</pre>
   <p>Normally this should not be necessary, because semantic is already prepared to
work perfectly with desktop.el. But if there are problems it's worth a try. 
Which modes you have to add depends on which modes of semantic you use. But to
get sure you should add all minor-modes of the semantic-package because these
modes are normally activated by the related &ldquo;global&rdquo; command (e.g. 
<code>global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode</code>) or by adding the minor-mode
to the related major-mode-hook.

   <p>It has also been reported that just disabling the Tip-Of-The-Day
(option: <code>ecb-tip-of-the-day</code>) fixes the compatibility-problems
with desktop.el. Just try it out!

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.6 Package edebug (Lisp Debugger)</h5>

<p><a name="index-edebug-365"></a>It is strongly recommended to run edebug only when the ECB-windows are
hidden. With visible ECB-windows there will probably serious conflicts
between the ECB-layout and the edebug-window-manager.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.7 Package ediff.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-ediff-366"></a>In most cases ECB works very well with ediff (see option
<code>ecb-run-ediff-in-ecb-frame</code>). But currently suspending ediff
with <code>ediff-suspend</code> and restoring the ediff-session (e.g. with
command <code>eregistry</code>) does confuse the window-management of ECB.

   <p>If you often use ediff in a scenario where you suspend ediff and
reactivate it later then it is recommended to exit ECB first
(<code>ecb-deactivate</code> or <code>ecb-minor-mode</code>)!

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.8 Package func-menu.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-func_002dmenu-package-367"></a>This package has been reported to produce some conflicts under some
circumstances when ECB is activated. Some of them could be reproduced
by the ECB-maintainer. So the recommendation is to disable
func-menu-support when using ECB. Normally using func-menu makes no
sense in combination with ECB because ECB provides the same and even
more informations as func-menu - so func-menu is redundant ;-)

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.9 Package Gnus (Newsreader)</h5>

<p><a name="index-Gnus-368"></a>As of ECB 2.21 there should be no conflicts between Gnus and ECB, so
Gnus can be used even when the ECB-windows are visible.

   <p>But if you encounter problems then it is recommened to use one of the
window-managers escreen.el or winring.el (see <a href="Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB.html#Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>). With such a window-manager ECB and Gnus should work together
very well under all circumstances!

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.10 Package JDEE (Java Development Environment)</h5>

<p><a name="index-JDEE-369"></a>JDEE has a lot of &ldquo;dialogs&rdquo; where the user can select among several
choices. An example is importing classes via the command
<code>jde-import-find-and-import</code>. These dialogs are strongly designed
to work in an environment where a new temporary window is created, the
contents of the dialog are displayed in the new window, the user
select his choice and hits [OK]. After that the new window is deleted
and the selection is performed (for example the chosen import
statement are inserted in the source-buffer.

   <p><strong>Caution</strong>: ECB can work very well with this dialogs but only if
the buffer-name of these dialog-buffers (normally &ldquo;Dialog&rdquo;) is not
contained in the option <code>ecb-compilation-buffer-names</code>. So do not
add the string &ldquo;Dialog&rdquo; to this option!

   <p><strong>Please Note</strong>: Regardless if a persistent compile-window is used
(i.e. <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil) or not, these
JDEE-dialogs will always being displayed by splitting the edit-window
of ECB and not within the compile-window.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.11 Package scroll-all.el (scroll-all-mode)</h5>

<p><a name="index-scroll_002dall_002dmode-370"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dall-371"></a>ECB advices <code>scroll-all-mode</code> so it is working correct during
running ECB. This means if point stays in an edit-window and the
edit-window is splitted then all edit-windows are scrolled by
<code>scroll-all-mode</code> and no other window! If point stays in any
other window just this selected window is scrolled. This is the only
senseful behavior of <code>scroll-all-mode</code> with ECB.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.12 Package VC (Version Control)</h5>

<p><a name="index-VC-package-372"></a><a name="index-Version-control-373"></a>The variable <code>vc-delete-logbuf-window</code> must be set to nil during
active ECB. This can be done with the hooks mentioned in <a href="Elisp-programming.html#Elisp-programming">Elisp programming</a>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.13 Package VM (Emacs Mail-Client)</h5>

<p><a name="index-VM-package-374"></a>As of ECB 2.21 there should be no conflicts between VM and ECB, so
VM can be used even when the ECB-windows are visible.

   <p>But if you encounter problems then it is recommened to use one of the
window-managers escreen.el or winring.el (see <a href="Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB.html#Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>). With such a window-manager ECB and VM should work together very
well under all circumstances!

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.14 Package winner.el (winner-mode)</h5>

<p><a name="index-winner_002dmode-375"></a><a name="index-winner-376"></a><code>winner-mode</code> is autom. disabled as long as ECB is running. ECB
has its own window-management which is completely incompatible with
<code>winner-mode</code>! But <code>winner-mode</code> makes also not really sense
with ECB.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.15 Package wb-line-number.el</h5>

<p><a name="index-wb_002dline_002dnumber-377"></a>
Do not use the package wb-line-number.el in combination with ECB - it
will not work and it will not work under any circumstances and there
is no way to make it work together and there will be no way in the
future!

   <p>The reason behind that is: wb-line-number.el uses additional dedicated
windows to display the line-numbers. And ECB can not work if there
there are additional dedicated windows - additional to that ones
created by ECB.

<h5 class="subsubsection">12.1.1.16 Application xrefactory</h5>

<p><a name="index-xrefactory-378"></a>Xrefactory (also known as Xref, X-ref and Xref-Speller), the
refactoring browser for (X)Emacs<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, can be used during running ECB regardless if the ECB-windows are
visible or not. There should be no conflicts as of ECB versions &gt;=
2.21.

   <p>If there are conflicts with the Xref-browser then the most recommended
way is to use one of the window-manager escreen.el or winring.el (and
then use different escreens or window-configurations for ECB and
Xrefactory-browsing - <a href="Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB.html#Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">12.1.2 What to do for unknown conflicts with other packages</h4>

<p>As of version 2.20 the layout-engine of ECB is so flexible that
normally there should be no conflicts with other packages unless these
packages have their own complete window-layout-management (e.g. Gnus,
BBDB, Xrefactory). But these packages can and should be handled very
well with the window-manager-support of ECB (see <a href="Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB.html#Window_002dmanagers-and-ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>).

   <p>So if you detect an unknown (i.e. not listed in the conflicts-list in
the next subsection) conflict with a small package and some of its
commands and you have installed an ECB-version &lt; 2.20 the first task
you have to do is to upgrade to a version &gt;= 2.20!

   <p>If this doesn't solve the problem a very probable reason for the
conflict is that the command fails if called from another window than
an edit-window of the ecb-frame. So please check if the problem
disappears if you call the failing command from an edit-window of ECB. 
If this is true then you you can add the following code to your
.emacs (and of course replace the XXX with the failing command):

<pre class="example">   (defecb-advice XXX before ecb-compatibility-advices
     "Ensures `XXX' works well when called from another window
   as an edit-window. Does nothing if called in another frame
   as the `ecb-frame'."
     (when (equal (selected-frame) ecb-frame)
       (unless (ecb-point-in-edit-window)
         (ecb-select-edit-window))))
</pre>
   <p>This before-advice runs before the command XXX and ensures that the
XXX is called from within an edit-window if the current selected
window is not an edit-window. It does nothing if called for another
frame as the ecb-frame.

   <p><strong>Please note</strong>: You have to define such compatibility advices exactly as
demonstrated in the example above, i.e. you must use the macro
<code>defecb-advice</code> and you have to use the advice-set
<code>ecb-compatibility-advices</code> (see the documentation of this macro)! The
advice-class is not necessary <code>before</code>, it can be <code>after</code> or
<code>around</code> too. Never use <code>defadvice</code> for ECB-advices!

   <p>If such an advice solves the problem then please send a note with the
solution to the ECB-mailing-list or direct to the ECB-maintainer so
the solution can be integrated in the next ECB-release

   <p>If calling from an edit-window fails too then please file a complete
bug-report to the ECB-mailing-list (see <a href="Submitting-problem-report.html#Submitting-problem-report">Submitting problem report</a>). This report should contain a detailed description which
command of which package fails under which circumstances!
