This is a minimal test case for cedets Ede/Maven2 support.

It has three parts, one rootproject and two child projects.

The ede function ede-compile-project should be able to build each of
the childs separately, and building the root will build the two
children as well. The rootproject is called an aggregator project in
mavens terminology.

The projects were made with "mvn archetype:generate" and edited a bit.
