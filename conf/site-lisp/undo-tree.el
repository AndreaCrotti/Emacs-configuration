;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs has a powerful undo system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in
;; most software, it allows you to recover *any* past state of a buffer
;; (whereas the standard undo/redo system can lose past states as soon as you
;; redo). However, this power comes at a price: many people find Emacs' undo
;; system confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that
;; replace it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system.
;;
;; Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo, and the confusion of Emacs'
;; undo, stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear sequence of
;; changes. It's not. The `undo-tree-mode' provided by this package replaces
;; Emacs' undo system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a
;; branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive
;; behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the power of
;; never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo history can in
;; some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate
;; before Emacs starts discarding history.
;;
;; The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it
;; was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the
;; best ideas from their competitors!
;;
;;
;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; This package has only been tested with Emacs versions 22, 23 and CVS. It
;; will not work without modifications in earlier versions of Emacs.
;;
;; To install `undo-tree-mode', make sure this file is saved in a directory in
;; your `load-path', and add the line:
;;
;;   (require 'undo-tree)
;;
;; to your .emacs file. Byte-compiling undo-tree.el is recommended (e.g. using
;; "M-x byte-compile-file" from within emacs).
;;
;; If you want to replace the standard Emacs' undo system with the
;; `undo-tree-mode' system in all buffers, you can enable it globally by
;; adding:
;;
;;   (global-undo-tree-mode)
;;
;; to your .emacs file.
;;
;;
;; Quick-Start
;; ===========
;;
;; If you're the kind of person who likes jump in the car and drive, without
;; bothering to first figure out whether the button on the left dips the
;; headlights or operates the ejector seat (after all, you'll soon figure it
;; out when you push it), then here's the minimum you need to know:
;;
;; `undo-tree-mode' and `global-undo-tree-mode'
;;   Enable undo-tree mode (either in the current buffer or globally).
;;
;; C-_  C-/  (`undo-tree-undo')
;;   Undo changes.
;;
;; M-_  C-?  (`undo-tree-redo')
;;   Redo changes.
;;
;; `undo-tree-switch-branch'
;;   Switch undo-tree branch.
;;   (What does this mean? Better press the button and see!)
;;

;; Undo Systems
;; ============
;;
;; To understand the different undo systems, it's easiest to consider an
;; example. Imagine you make a few edits in a buffer. As you edit, you
;; accumulate a history of changes, which we might visualize as a string of
;; past buffer states, growing downwards:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;
;;
;; Now imagine that you undo the last two changes. We can visualize this as
;; rewinding the current state back two steps:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;;
;; However, this isn't a good representation of what Emacs' undo system
;; does. Instead, it treats the undos as *new* changes to the buffer, and adds
;; them to the history:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (buffer state before undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (second undo)
;;
;;
;; Actually, since the buffer returns to a previous state after an undo, a
;; better way to visualize it is to imagine the string of changes turning back
;; on itself:
;;
;;        (initial buffer state)  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                  (first edit)  o  x  (second undo)
;;                                |  |
;;                                |  |
;;                 (second edit)  o  o  (first undo)
;;                                | /
;;                                |/
;;                                o  (buffer state before undo)
;;
;; Treating undos as new changes might seem a strange thing to do. But the
;; advantage becomes clear as soon as we imagine what happens when you edit
;; the buffer again. Since you've undone a couple of changes, new edits will
;; branch off from the buffer state that you've rewound to. Conceptually, it
;; looks like this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (new edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; The standard undo/redo system only lets you go backwards and forwards
;; linearly. So as soon as you make that new edit, it discards the old
;; branch. Emacs' undo just keeps adding changes to the end of the string. So
;; the undo history in the two systems now looks like this:
;;
;;            Undo/Redo:                      Emacs' undo
;;
;;               o                                o
;;               |                                |
;;               |                                |
;;               o                                o  o
;;               .\                               |  |\
;;               . \                              |  | \
;;               .  x  (new edit)                 o  o  |
;;   (discarded  .                                | /   |
;;     branch)   .                                |/    |
;;               .                                o     |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      x  (new edit)
;;
;; Now, what if you change your mind about those undos, and decide you did
;; like those other changes you'd made after all? With the standard undo/redo
;; system, you're stuck. There's no way to recover them, because that branch
;; was discarded when you made the new edit.
;;
;; However, in Emacs' undo system, those old buffer states are still there in
;; the undo history. You just have to rewind back through the new edit, and
;; back through the changes made by the undos, until you reach them. Of
;; course, since Emacs treats undos (even undos of undos!) as new changes,
;; you're really weaving backwards and forwards through the history, all the
;; time adding new changes to the end of the string as you go:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |
;;                       o  o     o  (undo new edit)
;;                       |  |\    |\
;;                       |  | \   | \
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  (undo the undo)
;;                       | /   |  |  |
;;                       |/    |  |  |
;;      (trying to get   o     |  |  x  (undo the undo)
;;       to this state)        | /
;;                             |/
;;                             o
;;
;; So far, this is still reasonably intuitive to use. It doesn't behave so
;; differently to standard undo/redo, except that by going back far enough you
;; can access changes that would be lost in standard undo/redo.
;;
;; However, imagine that after undoing as just described, you decide you
;; actually want to rewind right back to the initial state. If you're lucky,
;; and haven't invoked any command since the last undo, you can just keep on
;; undoing until you get back to the start:
;;
;;      (trying to get   o              x  (got there!)
;;       to this state)  |              |
;;                       |              |
;;                       o  o     o     o  (keep undoing)
;;                       |  |\    |\    |
;;                       |  | \   | \   |
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  o  (keep undoing)
;;                       | /   |  |  | /
;;                       |/    |  |  |/
;;      (already undid   o     |  |  o  (got this far)
;;       to this state)        | /
;;                             |/
;;                             o
;;
;; But if you're unlucky, you happen to have moved the point (say) after
;; getting to the point labelled "got this far". In that case, you've "broken
;; the undo chain". If you try to undo now, Emacs thinks you're trying to undo
;; the undos! So to get back to the initial state you now have to rewind
;; through *all* the changes, including the undos you just did:
;;
;;      (trying to get   o                          x  (finally got there!)
;;       to this state)  |                          |
;;                       |                          |
;;                       o  o     o     o     o     o
;;                       |  |\    |\    |\    |\    |
;;                       |  | \   | \   | \   | \   |
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  o  o  |  o  o
;;                       | /   |  |  | /   |  |  | /
;;                       |/    |  |  |/    |  |  |/
;;      (already undid   o     |  |  o<.   |  |  o
;;       to this state)        | /     :   | /
;;                             |/      :   |/
;;                             o       :   o
;;                                     :
;;                             (got this far, but
;;                              broke undo chain)
;;
;; Confused?
;;
;; In practice you can just hold down the undo key until you reach the buffer
;; state that you want. But whatever you do, don't move around in the buffer
;; to check you've got back to where you want! Because you'll break the undo
;; chain, and then you'll have to traverse the entire string of undos again to
;; get back to the point at which you broke the chain. Undo in region and
;; commands such as `undo-only' help to make using Emacs' undo a little
;; easier, but nonetheless it remains confusing for many people.
;;
;;
;; So what does `undo-tree-mode' do? Remember the diagram we drew to represent
;; the history we've been discussing (make a few edits, undo a couple of them,
;; and edit again)? The diagram that conceptually represented our undo
;; history, before we started discussing specific undo systems? It looked like
;; this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (current state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; Well, that's *exactly* what the undo history looks like to
;; `undo-tree-mode'.  It doesn't discard the old branch (as standard undo/redo
;; does), nor does it treat undos as new changes to be added to the end of a
;; linear string of buffer states (as Emacs' undo does). It just keeps track
;; of the tree of branching changes that make up the entire undo history.
;;
;; If you undo from this point, you'll rewind back up the tree to the previous
;; state:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (undo)
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; If you were to undo again, you'd rewind back to the initial state. If on
;; the other hand you redo the change, you'll end up back at the bottom of the
;; most recent branch:
;;
;;                                o  (undo takes you here)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (start here)
;;                                |\
;;                                | \
;;                                o  x  (redo takes you here)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o

;; So far, this is just like the standard undo/redo system. But what if you
;; want to return to a buffer state located on a previous branch of the
;; history? Since `undo-tree-mode' keeps the entire history, you simply need
;; to tell it to switch to a different branch, and then redo the changes you
;; want:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (start here, but switch
;;                                |\  to the other branch)
;;                                | \
;;                        (redo)  o  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                        (redo)  x
;;
;; Now you're on the other branch, and if you undo and redo changes you'll
;; stay on that branch, moving up and down through the buffer states located
;; on that branch. Until you decide to switch branches again, of course.
;;
;; Real undo trees might have multiple branches and sub-branches:
;;
;;                                o
;;                            ____|______
;;                           /           \
;;                          o             o
;;                      ____|__         __|
;;                     /    |  \       /   \
;;                    o     o   o     o     x
;;                    |               |
;;                   / \             / \
;;                  o   o           o   o
;;
;; Trying to imagine what Emacs' undo would do as you move about such a tree
;; will likely frazzle your brain circuits! But in `undo-tree-mode', you're
;; just moving around this undo history tree. Most of the time, you'll
;; probably only need to stay on the most recent branch, in which case it
;; behaves like standard undo/redo, so is just as simple to understand. But if
;; you ever need to recover a buffer state on a different branch, the
;; possibility of switching between branches and accessing the full undo
;; history is still there.
;;
;;
;;
;; The Undo-Tree Visualizer
;; ========================
;;
;; Actually, it gets better. You don't have to imagine all these tree
;; diagrams, because `undo-tree-mode' includes an undo-tree visualizer which
;; draws them for you! In fact, it draws even better diagrams: it highlights
;; the node representing the current buffer state, it highlights the current
;; branch, and you can toggle the display of time-stamps for each buffer
;; state. (There's one other tiny difference: the visualizer puts the most
;; recent branch on the left rather than the right.)
;;
;; In the visualizer, the usual keys for moving up and down a buffer instead
;; move up and down the undo history tree (e.g. the up and down arrow keys, or
;; "C-n" and "C-p"). The state of the "parent" buffer (the buffer whose undo
;; history you are visualizing) is updated as you move around the undo tree in
;; the visualizer. If you reach a branch point in the visualizer, the usual
;; keys for moving forward and backward in a buffer instead switch which
;; branch to follow (e.g. the left and right arrow keys, or "C-f" and "C-b").
;; Clicking with the mouse on any node in the visualizer will take you
;; directly to that node, resetting the state of the parent buffer to the
;; state represented by that node.
;;
;; It can be useful to see how long ago the parent buffer was in the state
;; represented by a particular node in the visualizer. Hitting "t" in the
;; visualizer toggles the display of time-stamps for all the nodes. (Note
;; that, because of the way `undo-tree-mode' works, these time-stamps may be
;; somewhat later than the true times, especially if it's been a long time
;; since you last undid any changes.)
;;
;; Finally, hitting "q" will quit the visualizer, leaving the parent buffer in
;; whatever state you were last on.
;;
;;
;;
;; Drawbacks
;; =========
;;
;; Emacs' undo system is deeply embedded in Emacs. In particular, garbage
;; collection treats the `buffer-undo-list' specially: references to markers
;; in `buffer-undo-list' don't count during the mark phase, and the sweep
;; phase removes undo entries for markers that have been garbage-collected.
;; This behaviour is implemented in C as part of the garbage collection code,
;; and it is difficult or impossible to emulate in Elisp.
;;
;; To avoid dead markers being resurrected in `undo-tree-mode', and to allow
;; them to be garbage-collected, `undo-tree-mode' doesn't record marker
;; adjustments. Markers are rarely explicitly created by users, so the impact
;; of this will primarily be through its effects on other features that make
;; use of markers. Since marker adjustments haven't always been restored by
;; undo, and even then it was buggy until recently (see Emacs bug#4803), it
;; seems likely that relatively little code relies heavily on correct marker
;; restoration.
;;
;; `undo-tree-mode' doesn't support "undo in region", i.e. selectively undoing
;; only the changes that affect the region. Support for this is planned for a
;; future version.



;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 0.1.6
;; * added `undo-tree-mode-lighter' customization option to allow the
;;   mode-line lighter to be changed
;; * bug-fix in `undo-tree-discard-node'
;; * added `undo-tree-save-state-to-register' and
;;   `undo-tree-restore-state-from-register' commands and keybindings for
;;   saving/restoring buffer states using registers
;;
;; Version 0.1.5
;; * modified `undo-tree-visualize' to mark the visualizer window as
;;   soft-dedicated and changed `undo-tree-visualizer-quit' to use
;;   `kill-buffer', so that visualizer window is deleted along with buffer if
;;   visualizer buffer was displayed in a new window, but not if it was
;;   displayed in an existing window.
;;
;; Version 0.1.4
;; * modified `undo-tree-undo' and `undo-tree-redo' to always replace
;;   redo/undo entries with new ones generated by `primitive-undo', as the new
;;   changesets will restore the point more reliably
;;
;; Version 0.1.3
;; * fixed `undo-tree-visualizer-quit' to remove `after-change-functions'
;;   hook there, rather than in `undo-tree-kill-visualizer'
;;
;; Version 0.1.2
;; * fixed keybindings
;; * renamed `undo-tree-visualizer-switch-previous-branch' and
;;   `undo-tree-visualizer-switch-next-branch' to
;;   `undo-tree-visualizer-switch-branch-left' and
;;   `undo-tree-visualizer-switch-branch-right'
;;
;; Version 0.1.1
;; * prevented `undo-tree-kill-visualizer' from killing visualizer when
;;   undoing/redoing from the visualizer, which completely broke the
;;   visualizer!
;; * changed one redo binding, so that at least one set of undo/redo bindings
;;   works in a terminal
;; * bound vertical scrolling commands in `undo-tree-visualizer-map', in case
;;   they aren't bound globally
;; * added missing :group argument to `defface's
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * initial release
